Alleged Pixel 7 prototype hits eBay months ahead of the phone’s official release,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147576/google-pixel-7-pro-prototype-ebay,"An alleged prototype of Google’s upcoming Pixel 7 smartphone has been posted on eBay, giving us our first look at the new phone in the wild months ahead of its scheduled fall release (via Android guru Mishaal Rahman). Google just revealed the phone a few weeks ago at Google I/O, and what we can see in the prototype matches up with what Google has already shown. The distinctive camera bar is back, and this year it’s an aluminum bar with cutouts for the cameras. And the alleged prototype’s casing is a deep black that looks just like one of the colors Google showed off at I/O. The eBay listing includes a few photos of the front, back, and sides of the device, though there’s not much to see that you can’t already spot on Google’s official renders. A photo of the phone turned on shows it has 128GB of storage, which suggests Google will once again be offering a 128GB model as an option for the final phone. A screenshot says that the phone’s model is GVU6C. And one photo indicates that this eBay seller may have gotten their hands on a Pixel 7 Pro as well, as you can catch the reflection of what looks to be the Pixel 7 Pro’s camera bar on the back of the Pixel 7 prototype. We’ve collected images from the eBay listing into the gallery below, if you want to scrutinize them for yourself: In messages with The Verge, the seller claims they bought the Pixel 7 prototype from a wholesaler without knowing what it was. The seller says they realized it was a Pixel 7 after doing research and seeing pictures that seemed like the phone they had. They also say they had a Pixel 7 Pro, but sold it already. The listing has been closed, so you won’t be able to snap up this device for your collection. There were no bids for the prototype, and the starting bid was $450. Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. This Pixel 7 listing is just the latest major pre-release leak of a Pixel device, which has a history of surprise appearances dating back to the very first phone to carry the name. A prototype of a Pixel Watch was apparently found at a restaurant shortly before the smartwatch’s announcement at I/O. A mention of the Pixel 6A appeared in a coloring book all the way back in January. Somebody filmed what appeared to be a Pixel 6 Pro test unit a few weeks before Google officially launched the device. I could go on. Unfortunately, we’ll likely be waiting a few months before Google shares more about the Pixel 7. The phones aren’t set to arrive until the fall, and if past years are any indication, we should expect some kind of launch event in October. Until then, these photos from eBay might be our best look at the upcoming phone... well, until it inevitably leaks again.

"Oddly enough, The Weather Channel makes for a pretty great streaming service",https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23144935/weather-channel-streaming-service-app-personalization,"The Weather Channel is not trying to win you over by spending big on its version of House of Cards. It’s not bidding on The Office next time it comes up, nor is it interested in NFL games. “Our tentpole is Mother Nature,” says Nora Zimmett, TWC’s chief content officer. “And she’s always delivering weather.” TWC launched a dedicated streaming service this month. It costs $2.99 a month or $29.99 a year, and it is ... well, it’s The Weather Channel. The app’s main screen is an always-on stream that replicates exactly what you’d see on cable. That, Zimmett says, is what viewers were actually looking for. “We looked at our audience and heard, ‘where can I get The Weather Channel if I don’t want to pay $200 a month for a traditional bundle?’” she says. Rather than try to reinvent itself for streaming, TWC opted to just stream its channel. This is a surprisingly novel idea in the streaming world, by the way. Most networks have linear TV deals that specify when and where content is allowed to appear; that’s why most shows only stream after they air, and some don’t stream at all. That causes a particularly big problem for news, sports, and other particularly timely content. Who’s going to stream a “live news report” from last week, or even last night? Meanwhile, those linear deals continue to be hugely lucrative for those networks, and most are not eager to dump cable (and its carriage fees) a minute before they have to. As a result, you get services like CNN Plus, which tried to build an entirely new lineup of live shows rather than simply streaming its existing ones. And we all know how that went. “We are at a weird inflection point in our industry,” Zimmett says, “where we have one foot in cable and one foot in streaming. And I think all companies are still trying to figure out how to keep both sides happy – legally, financially, and everything else in between.” The Weather Channel’s bet, here, seems to be that it’s so essential to viewers that it can have it both ways. We’ll see how that pans out: The Weather Channel has had its fair share of fee disputes, and the new streaming service isn’t likely to make the carriers happy. TWC has another weird corporate situation to deal with, too: The Weather Channel as you know it online and in mobile apps is owned by IBM and is an entirely separate entity from the TV network. As a result, you can’t stream the TWC service on mobile or PCs, only TVs (according to the FAQ, it’s available on “Roku, Fire TV, Android TV, Samsung Smart TV, and Xfinity Flex,” with Vizio support planned in the future). Which is a bummer. From a content perspective, though, The Weather Channel is a surprisingly clever study in how to take a linear-TV channel and make it feel more internet-y. When you open The Weather Channel’s streaming app, you’re dropped right into the linear feed, the same one everyone’s watching all over the country. But the blue ticker at the bottom? That’s personalized to your local weather, a running feed of everything you need to know right now. You can also call up a full-screen radar to see what’s coming, relegating the live show to one corner of the screen. I spent most of my time in that view, with local weather on most of the screen and the news and shows on the rest, and all I could think was, “boy does this have Doctor’s Waiting Room TV written all over it.” This is the part where you say, Wait, hang on, who watches The Weather Channel? My phone tells me if it’s raining. The answer is more people than you’d think, but the outlook’s not great: TWC’s total viewership has grown over the last couple of years, but it’s losing ground with younger viewers. Those are precisely the people TWC is hoping to reach with its streaming service. And as climate change becomes an ever-more important story, Zimmett says she thinks there’s more to the weather than the forecast. “Our superpower is visualizing data,” Zimmett says. She’s not wrong: TWC has long been known for its mixed-reality graphics, including the Unreal Engine-powered animation that showed what a nine-foot Hurricane Florence storm surge might look like. Expect much, much more of that going forward. “At the end of the day, if I feel like my family is in danger due to a storm, I really don’t need a 2D map with orange and yellow colors over it,” Zimmett says. “I want to see someone live in it to show me what’s coming, or to give me a futuristic look at what’s coming to my doorstep.” There are plenty of places The Weather Channel could and doesn’t embrace this kind of personalization and interactivity, though. I watched a few hours of the service while a red tornado warning spun around in the bottom right corner, but I couldn’t click on it or learn anything else about what was going on. The Weather Channel does have some on-demand content, though it’s mostly short clips and explainers and behind-the-scenes footage. But Zimmett says she has plans. TWC does have some original programming, including Uncharted Adventure, which Zimmett proudly noted was recently nominated for a Daytime Emmy. Going forward, TWC plans to make its new shows available on-demand on its streaming service 48 hours before they appear on the live network and stream. (I did watch a couple of episodes of Uncharted Adventure, by the way. It’s a fun show, like a mix between a travel vlog and Man vs. Wild.) The streaming service is already starting to change the way TWC thinks about its linear programming, too. Zimmett says she’s been inspired by streaming sports, as she’s thought about the future of weather coverage. Like the NFL RedZone channel: “maybe we’re covering 10 storms at once, and there’s an automatic channel that anytime you’re getting close to landfall, we’re going to take you there.” Or the new alternative broadcasts for games: “We’re really looking at covering weather as an event, which we’ve always done, but doing it in a choose-your-own-adventure way that really brings the storm to the doorsteps of our users.” But let’s be clear: the weather is still the star of the show here. In a certain, cynical sort of way, it’s never been better to be The Weather Channel. Climate change is making the weather more volatile and making natural disasters more frequent, which is exactly the kind of thing that makes a viewer flip to TWC. Hurricane season is just about to start, and the NOAA is predicting it’s going to be an “above-normal” year. Zimmett says TWC is trying to use the opportunity not to traffic in disaster porn — though you could accuse the company of occasionally doing that, it does love horrifying storm footage — but to educate people about the science behind the weather. “It’s critical to us,” she says. “We cannot have a climate conversation without having a weather conversation.” There’s really no chance that The Weather Channel can compete with Netflix, Disney Plus, and HBO Max to be your go-to entertainment platform. But maybe it doesn’t have to. The company is betting that as the world shifts to streaming, a huge number of viewers aren’t looking for something radically different than the TV they’re used to; they just want it to be more convenient and less expensive. It’s both personalized and a shared experience, both always-on and on-demand, and still only a couple of clicks away. (Once it gets to Vizio and Apple TV and the other platforms, anyway.) And with the weather getting more outrageous seemingly every day, there’s always going to be something to watch.","['weather channel', 'streaming twc', 'tv deals', 'broadcasts games', 'channel app']"

DeLorean offers a first look at its gull-winged Alpha 5 EV revival,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147339/delorean-alpha-5-first-look-gull-winged-ev-revival,"DeLorean Motor Company has revealed the first images of the Alpha 5 electric vehicle (EV), the brand’s attempt at resurrecting the DeLorean name in an all-electric form. Staying true to the classic ‘80s-era DeLorean known for its appearance in Back to the Future, the Alpha 5 comes with those iconic gull-wing doors and can reach 60mph in about 2.99 seconds (or 88mph in 4.35 seconds, if you’re curious). Before we dive into the details, it’s worth noting the company behind the Alpha 5 isn’t actually the same one behind the original DeLorean vehicles — that company went defunct in 1982. An unrelated Texas-based company, which supplies replacement parts to the owners of vintage DeLorean vehicles, snapped up the rights to the DeLorean brand and teased an all-electric revival in April. The Alpha 5 could come with a 100kWh battery, offering an estimated 300 miles of range and a top speed of 155mph. DeLorean indicates these specs will belong to the “base” performance model, but there isn’t any word on other possible performance tiers or pricing. While the Alpha 5 does hint at its heritage to its gas-powered predecessor with gull-winged doors and a sloped design, it trades an angular look for smoother curves and four seats instead of two. Despite some obvious differences, DeLorean partnered with Italdesign, the same Volkswagen-owned design team that helped develop the look of the 1981 DMC-12, and its take on the electrified version ushers it into the future. DeLorean plans on showing off the Alpha 5 to the public on its website tomorrow morning, but you can sign up to get a sneak peek at its images and specs right now. We’ll have to wait a bit longer to see the car in action, though, as DeLorean’s set to reveal the Alpha 5 in Pebble Beach on August 21st.","['delorean electric', 'pricing alpha', 'ev brand', '88mph 35', 'performance tiers']"
The merging of Comixology and Kindle has created a hell I’d like to escape,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23140157/comixology-amazon-kindle-integration-terrible,"In February of this year, Amazon finally completed its consumption of the once independent app for downloading comics, Comixology. Amazon had acquired the app way back in 2013, and apart from removing the ability to buy comics directly from the app, it left it untouched for nearly a decade. But this year, Amazon changed things — incorporating Comixology’s digital marketplace directly into the Kindle ecosystem and totally redesigning the Comixology app. It has taken two distinct mediums — digital comics and digital books — and smashed them together into an unholy blob of content that is worse in every single way. Apparently, if you let one company acquire a near-monopoly in the digital books and comics spaces, it will do terrible things that make the experience worse. For those of you who aren’t big comic nerds, Comixology is the largest marketplace for digital comics. If you don’t want to pay for individual monthly subscriptions to publishers, it’s the only per-issue supplier of digital comics from a number of major publishers, including DC Comics and Image. If you read comics and want to avoid the issues of storing your physical collection, Comixology has, until recently, always provided a pretty solid catchall alternative. Related Kindle, meanwhile, has maintained a de facto monopoly in the digital books space in the United States. Amazon’s e-readers are the most widely purchased in the US, with Rakuten’s Kobo line of e-readers (Rakuten is the largest bookseller in Japan) and Barnes & Noble’s line of Nook e-readers trailing behind. If you think the enormity of these marketplaces would mean Kindle or Comixology were the best, you’d be sorely mistaken. They’ve succeeded entirely due to their size — not their quality. Amazon is so large it can regularly use its size to pressure publishers or ignore them. In 2019, Amazon shipped numerous copies of the sequel to Margaret Atwood’s Handmaid’s Tale a week in advance, and despite an uproar from independent booksellers, it suffered no issues with the publisher, Penguin Random House. Penguin Random House didn’t even mention Amazon when apologizing to readers and booksellers for the broken embargo. Amazon’s increasingly outside role in digital publishing had led me to try and cut back on using its services. So when Amazon completed its integration of Comixology in February, it took me a little while to notice. But oh boy, I’ve started noticing lately. The new Comixology app is largely just... annoying. That’s the best word for it. Everything you need is still there, but the design isn’t really intuitive, and it can make a large collection of comics (I’ve been using Comixology since 2011) difficult to navigate. It feels sort of like when you go to the grocery store after they move aisles around. Everything is still there, but the change feels so dramatic after years of the familiar. But where my local Food Bazaar will helpfully label the aisles, Comixology has not. There are no clear labels for useful built-in tools like its “Guided View,” which is designed to fluidly move you from panel to panel with a swipe instead of having each page take up the whole display. The Guided View is still there, but the clear explanation of what it is or how to use it is gone. You access it by double-tapping — which I only know because I was trying to access the menu to leave the book. Yet the real pain of the new Comixology experience is its store’s integration with the larger Amazon store. Amazon’s always been a struggle to navigate. There are the fake products, the sponsored ads, and sometimes even fake products in sponsored ads. When I went to preorder the new Poison Ivy series, about the DC villainess, earlier this month, I was instead met with salves used to treat poison ivy rashes. wanted to preorder the new poison ivy comic and was instead violently reminded of comixology being ruined by Amazon (the comic I wanted is the third actual book down) pic.twitter.com/4tFemED9YP In the three weeks since, they’ve fixed that search result. The new book is now the top result. The salves come after. The rest of the Poison Ivy-focused books DC has released over the years are now “below the fold,” hidden until you scroll past the sponsored junk you probably weren’t searching for. Other popular heroes, like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Batman, return toy results right alongside the comics. Comixology searches used to just return comic results. And look, those search results weren’t exactly great before the merge. There have to be a million variations on the Spider-Man title. If you’re looking for issue 10 of a very specific Spider-Man run, you’re probably going to be sifting through a lot of results unless you add more to your query. But pre-Amazon merger, you weren’t also dodging results for Amazon Prime TV shows, toys, salves and anything else Amazon thinks a searcher of Spider-Man comics might want to buy. Using the service now, you are reminded, painfully, at every turn, that you are in Amazon’s house and you will consider more than just the one thing you wanted to buy. It’s obtrusive and unpleasant. And for months, I have griped out about it with friends and read about it while nodding in agreement and generally accepted the unpleasantness. But last week, I wanted to read a book in the Kindle app. I hadn’t used it in a while, preferring Libby when I can, but I knew I owned this book, and I knew I wanted to read it. Only instead of being met with the myriad of books I’ve acquired over a decade of using the Amazon Kindle store, I was met with the myriad of comics I’ve acquired over a decade of using the Comixology store. There’s no way to filter the comics out of my Kindle app. They’re always just right there. The first thing I’ve seen if I haven’t purchased a book that week. It is annoying on my iPad Mini. It is downright offensive on my Android E-Ink tablet and Kindle Oasis. It also doesn’t have to be this way. Amazon is one of the largest and wealthiest companies in the world. It has money to spare on front-end user interface designers. It could sort this out quickly. But I don’t think Amazon has any inclination to. For the most part, Amazon is content to maintain its ebook business, not be actual leaders or good stewards. And it’s not just the bonehead design choices that came after merging its digital comics and ebook stores that have me feeling this way. The Kindle lineup of e-readers now feels painfully outdated next to something like the Kobo Elipsa and Sage or basically the entire Onyx Boox lineup. Those use the latest E-Ink displays and include fancy abilities like faster refresh rates for web browsing and stylus input. The biggest thing going for the Kindle lineup is the e-readers are relatively cheap and work with Amazon’s store. Amazon has left its main book-recommending app, Goodreads, to wallow, too. The app doesn’t appear to have had a UI refresh since Amazon acquired it in 2013. In fact, it looks a lot like it did when it launched in 2007. Other apps, like Netflix, Facebook, and Google, have grown powerful using their immense amount of data to develop algorithms that try to anticipate what you want to read or watch before you do. Goodreads just recommends whatever is popular widely and in a genre vaguely adjacent. From the store to the recommendation service to the Kindle hardware, Amazon could do a whole lot better. Yet it’s as if Amazon actually likes how little effort it has to exert over its enormous monopoly to continue raking in dollars. Earlier this year, Comixology CEO David Steinberger left to “lead a new Amazon-wide initiative that is too good an opportunity to not take.” In a Twitter thread, he assured he would be with Comixology in an advisory role. From the outside, it sure seems like Amazon went and rewarded ineptitude with a promotion. I’d be more annoyed, but I’m still trying to find that book I wanted to read on my Kindle.","['comics kindle', 'comixology amazon', 'subscriptions publishers', 'comics comixology', 'maintain ebook']"
The Real-World AI Issue,https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18194816/ai-artificial-intelligence-issue,"The term “artificial intelligence” was coined fairly recently in 1955, but the idea of smart machines that do our bidding has far deeper roots, going back to the ancient myths of Greece, India, and China. Perhaps that’s why AI has such an impact on our imagination, and why, in recent years, there’s been so much hype surrounding the technology. But AI is not a myth, nor is it a magical machine. It’s a technology like any other, that, after decades of research, has reached a new plateau of productivity. Cheap processing power and abundant data have made this possible, and AI and machine learning are now useful tools in a diverse range of fields, including astronomy, health care, transportation, and music. After years of promise, AI is finally becoming useful. But what usually happens to useful technologies is that they disappear. We forget about the things that just work, and we shouldn’t let that happen to AI. Any technology destined to change the world needs scrutiny, and AI, with its combination of huge imaginative presence and very real, very dangerous failings, needs that scrutiny more than most. So, for the AI Issue at The Verge, we’re taking a closer look at some of the ways artificial intelligence and machine learning are affecting technology right now — because it’s too late to understand something after it’s changed the world.

Amazon is ending Cloud Cam service and offering owners a free Blink Mini,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147362/amazon-cloud-cam-shutting-down-free-blink-mini-echo-replacement,"Amazon is ending support for its Cloud Cam security camera and offering owners a free Blink Mini to replace it. MacRumors noted the change late last week, and The Verge obtained a copy of an email sent to customers announcing the change. Cloud Cam owners will be able to use their cameras and download video until December 2nd of this year, after which all recordings will be deleted and the hardware will no longer function. Customers with the Cloud Cam Key Edition will also lose the ability to connect to smart locks, although they can get a free fourth-generation Echo to replace the functionality. “As the number of Alexa smart home devices continues to grow, we are focusing efforts on Ring, Blink, and other technologies that make your home smarter and simplify your everyday routines. Therefore, we have decided to no longer continue support for Amazon Cloud Cam and its companion apps,” Amazon said in its email, which was also posted on Reddit. In a statement to MacRumors, Amazon added that “we will continue to offer innovative smart home security solutions for our customers through Amazon’s Ring and Blink brands.” It also specified that it will give Blink Mini cameras to users who are “still actively using their Cloud Cam,” although it’s not clear if that’s a formal criteria for getting the free replacement. Cloud Cam owners will be emailed instructions for redeeming their free Blink Mini and (for Key Edition owners) Echo before the December 2nd deadline. The Blink Mini will come with a one-year subscription to Blink Subscription Plus, which typically costs $10 per month or $100 per year. A subscription — either to Plus or the $3 per month single-camera Basic plan — is required for many Blink features, including rapid access to videos and motion-activated recording. Cloud Cam also required a paid subscription for advanced features, although it offered some free options that require payment on the Blink Mini. The Cloud Cam lineup launched in 2017 and wound down in late 2019 after Amazon acquired the security camera makers Blink and Ring. Now, Amazon is following a well-established pattern of companies bricking smart home hardware because they no longer want to support its ecosystem. Customers won’t be left completely without recourse thanks to the replacement — but they’ll still end up with some useless hardware that they may have bought just a few years ago.","['cloud cam', 'alexa smart', 'blink technologies', 'support amazon', 'home devices']"
This iPad Mini 6 case offers MagSafe-like charging capability,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23144394/pitaka-ipad-mini-6-magez-case-pro-magnetic-magsafe-charging-price-specs-features,"If you’ve wanted MagSafe-style convenient charging on an iPad Mini, Pitaka’s latest case is here for you. The new $79 MagEZ Case Pro for the sixth-generation iPad Mini (aka the iPad Mini 6) has magnetic points on the back that pass power through the iPad’s USB-C port when used with the included pad. Or you can use it with the $129 MagEZ Charging Stand, which elevates the tablet and provides a second Qi charging spot in its base for a phone or headphones. There are some downsides to this approach. Pitaka’s case doesn’t make use of the magnets built into the back of the iPad Mini, and it blocks the USB-C port from access, leaving you with the magnetic pad as the only way to charge the device. Forget about transferring any data over a wired connection while the case is on, too. The case itself is a stiff rubber with a carbon fiber-like weave pattern, which should provide protection from most average drops but isn’t the most rugged thing I’ve seen. It also doesn’t cover the screen like Apple’s folio cases, so you’ll probably want to pair it with some kind of screen protector. On the plus side, the case does allow for Apple Pencil charging on the right side, and there’s a little accessory that grabs the Pencil and holds it in place better when you toss the iPad in a bag. Those downsides aside, the MagEZ certainly lives up to the easy part of its name, as charging just requires plopping the case near the base and letting the magnets do their thing. The magnetic attraction is strong, and the stand will hold the iPad easily in either landscape or portrait orientation. (The stand also tilts, but it does not have any height adjustment.) Neither the case nor the stand comes with a charging brick, and Pitaka recommends at least a 45W USB-C Power Delivery brick if you want to charge the iPad and a phone at full speed at the same time on the stand. (The base supports 7.5W charging with iPhones or up to 15W charging with other Qi devices.) You do have to really be committed to wanting magnetic charging to make this setup worthwhile, though, as neither the case nor the stand is particularly cheap. But if that’s not a blocker for you, both accessories should be available starting today, May 30th.","['magnetic charging', 'ipad mini', 'pitaka case', 'charge ipad', 'mini magnetic']"
Pixel Tablet could include support for third-party styluses,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147251/usi-universal-stylus-initiative-google-pixel-tablet,"Google’s upcoming Pixel Tablet might support the cross-manufacturer USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) standard, allowing it to be used with a range of third party styluses, if a recently-discovered entry in the USI’s list of certified products is to be believed. The entry, which we spotted via NuGiz, lists a device from Google with the product name “Tangor” and the model number “Tablet,” which are presumably placeholder names for the Android-powered tablet Google announced earlier this month. USI is an industry-wide stylus standard that Google joined in 2018. It’s already supported across a range of Chromebooks, allowing them to be used with a variety of styluses from different manufacturers. But while there are plenty of proprietary stylus / Android tablet offerings (like Samsung’s S Pen for its Galaxy tablets), no tablets have been certified to work with the universal USI standard. Earlier this year, the USI announced version 2.0 of the standard. This version includes a new wireless charging feature that could allow compatible styluses to be charged by simply being placed next to a supported device, similar to what Apple offers with the Apple Pencil 2 and select iPads. It’s unclear which version of the standard Google’s tablet might support. As 9to5Google notes, it seems unusual that Google’s tablet has appeared in the USI’s database this early, after Google said it’s targeting a 2023 release.

Apple’s RealityOS for rumored headset appears in trademark application,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147213/realityos-os-ros-trademark-apple-virtual-augmented-reality-headset,"RealityOS — the name Apple is reportedly using for the operating system running on its rumored virtual and augmented reality headset — has appeared in a trademark filing spotted by Parker Ortolani. Bloomberg News was first to report the “reality operating system” branding back in 2017, and references to the name have appeared in Apple’s software. The trademark application hasn’t officially been filed by Apple, but it’s common practice for large companies to apply for trademarks under one-off company names — like Realityo Systems LLC, in this case — in the state of Delaware for the sole purpose of maintaining anonymity. The trademark application is the latest evidence that Apple is on the cusp of announcing its long-rumored headset. It follows the news earlier this month that the company’s board of directors reportedly tried out the wearable device, which is common practice ahead of a public launch. In January, Bloomberg News reported that the headset was originally planned for release in late 2022 after an announcement at the company’s developer conference, but that could be delayed due to development challenges. The headset’s release could now happen in 2023, according to Bloomberg. The trademarks are also the only ones owned by this company “Realityo Systems LLC.” They were originally filed on December 8, 2021. This was just two months before “realityOS” began showing up in Apple source code. The trademark documentation references “wearable computer hardware” and is said to relate to “design and development of computer hardware, software, peripherals, and computer and video games.” The design and functionality of Apple’s headset has been the source of much speculation over the years, but most reports suggest that it’ll be able to offer a combination of virtual reality and augmented reality experiences, immersing you in virtual content as well as layering virtual elements over real world environments. It’s important to note that the RealityOS trademark hasn’t been applied for by Apple itself, and has instead been registered by a company called “Realityo Systems LLC.” But Ortolani reports that Realityo doesn’t appear to have any public presence, suggesting that it’s a shell company used by the Cupertino-based tech company to hide its involvement. Apple has reportedly taken the same approach in the past, 9to5Mac reports, using a shell company called “Yosemite Research LLC” to register macOS update names like Yosemite, Big Sur, and Monterey. The kicker? Both Realityo Systems LLC and Yosemite Research LLC are registered at the same address, which heavily implies that Apple is behind them. The RealityOS filings for a trademark and service mark don’t list any examples of the name’s use in public (meaning the product they’re associated with is yet to be released), and they’re also the only two applications associated with Realityo Systems LLC. The applications have been discovered just days before Apple is due to kick off its annual developer conference next week on June 6th, and are listed with deadlines of June 8th, leading to speculation that we could see the headset announced during Apple’s keynote. But Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman notes that the timing of the June 8th date is likely a coincidence, and coincides with a key legal deadline that comes six months after a trademark is originally filed. “Maybe we’ll see it [at WWDC],” Gurman tweeted, “but the trademark application isn’t evidence of that.”","['realityos trademark', 'apple headset', 'apple realityos', '2022 announcement', 'references wearable']"
"For $500, you can buy the Third Sister’s 6.5-foot double-bladed lightsaber",https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/29/23146694/double-bladed-lightsaber-costs-500-star-wars-obi-wan-third-sister-reva,"Hasbro has designed a lifelike lightsaber just in time for the premiere of the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series, one that might be the toymaker’s most ambitious — and expensive — replica yet. The Black Series Reva Force FX Elite Lightsaber costs $499 and measures a total of 6.5 feet long with both blades attached. It’s modeled after the lightsaber wielded by the Third Sister, also known as Reva, a cold and callous Inquisitor set on hunting down Obi-Wan. Just like the iconic lightsabers we’ve seen held by Inquisitors in past Star Wars series, you can take off one of the blades, as well as remove half of the circle in the center of the lightsaber. There are a number of cool lighting and sound effects that you can activate too, and they work whether you’re using one or both blades. While a progressive ignition effect has the lightsaber loading up with red light in preparation for battle, a blast deflect effect eliminates lighting in particular areas of the lightsaber (complete with “pew pew” sound effects) to make it look like you’re shielding yourself from projectiles. There’s even a wall-cutting mode that turns the tip of the lightsaber bright white while emitting a buzzing sound as if you’re actually cutting through metal. Unfortunately, it does have some (expected) limitations — it doesn’t spin on its own, so you can’t use it as a sort of helicopter to propel yourself short distances or repel enemy attacks (something shown quite often in Star Wars Rebels). You’ll have to get your baton-twirling skills in order if you really want to get in on that spinning action. The Third Sister’s lightsaber looks like Hasbro’s most expensive so far, likely because of the double blades. Taking a look at Hasbro’s collection of lightsabers, the FX Force Elite replicas don’t seem to go over $300. You can check out Reva’s lightsaber for yourself on its crowdfunding page, which will almost certainly fulfill the 5,000 backer requirement (because who wouldn’t want the chance to say they have a 6.5-foot lightsaber in their home?). It’ll be available for purchase until July 11th at 11:59PM ET, but won’t start shipping until fall 2023. Correction May 30th, 8:12AM ET: A previous version of this article stated that there was a $5,000 crowdfunding requirement when it is actually a 5,000 backer requirement. We regret the error.","['lightsaber costs', 'blast deflect', 'reva lightsaber', 'modeled lightsaber', 'eliminates lighting']"
"Apple can’t dismiss Cydia’s amended antitrust lawsuit, judge says",https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/29/23146529/apple-cant-dismiss-cydia-antitrust-lawsuit-judge,"Apple’s attempt to dismiss an amended antitrust lawsuit filed by the creator of Cydia, an app store for jailbroken iPhones, has failed (via Reuters). California District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers denied Apple’s motion to dismiss the case on Thursday and is giving the company 21 days to respond to Cydia’s refiled complaint. Cydia developer Jay Freeman (who also goes by the username Saurik), first filed a lawsuit against Apple in 2020. The complaint alleges Apple “has wrongfully acquired and maintained monopoly power” in iOS app distribution and payments, ultimately “depriving” third-party app stores of “the ability to compete with the App Store.” Cydia emerged before the Apple App Store even existed, and allowed users to find and download third-party apps for jailbroken devices. Freeman shut down the Cydia store in 2018. Judge Gonzalez Rogers — the same judge who issued a mixed ruling for the Epic vs. Apple trial —  dismissed the case in January, citing Freeman’s claims were outside of the four-year statute of limitations for antitrust lawsuits. Gonzalez Rogers still gave Freeman the chance to amend the complaint, which is what he did. The fresh complaint argues that from 2018 to 2021, Apple implemented “more aggressive” changes in iOS that allegedly prevented Cydia and other alternative app stores from providing “useable” apps for iPhones. Apple once again sought to shut down the refiled complaint on the basis that the allegations occurred outside the statute of limitations, but Gonzalez Rogers denied the motion for dismissal. The Verge reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. In 2020, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple following Fortnite’s removal from the App Store — Apple kicked out Fornite for offering an alternate payment option, enabling Epic to get around Apple’s up to 30 percent commission it takes from in-app purchases. Epic filed a similar lawsuit against Google around the same time, which is set to go to trial in 2023. Earlier this month, Match Group, the company behind Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge also filed a lawsuit against Google for its payment restrictions on the Play Store. In addition to app developers, Apple has been the subject of scrutiny from government agencies. While the Netherlands waged a string of fines against the company for barring Dutch dating apps from using their own billing systems, South Korea has passed a law requiring both Apple and Google to let developers incorporate third-party payment processors. The US and EU are working to clamp down on the power of large technology companies as well, with the EU set to enact the Digital Markets Act next year, and the US making progress with the Open App Markets Act designed to promote competition in mobile computing.","['lawsuit apple', 'cydia app', 'app store', 'jailbroken iphones', 'ios allegedly']"
iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max could finally get always-on display,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/29/23146454/iphone-14-pro-max-always-on-display-apple-wwdc-rumors,"Apple may finally bring always-on display to the upcoming iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. According to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple could introduce the feature with iOS 16, allowing the iPhone to display a limited amount of information even when it’s locked. Gurman says the iPhone’s version of always-on mode could work similarly to the way it does with the Apple Watch Series 5 and up — the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will drop the lock screen’s frame rate with always-on mode enabled, letting them conserve energy while the display remains powered on. It’s unclear if the new iPhone will use the same low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) display Apple uses in newer Watch models. These low-powered screens play a huge part in getting always-on mode to work properly, as they're built to keep devices from consuming too much power. Last year, analysts predicted that the iPhone 13 would come with an LTPO display to enable always-on display. A number of Android devices already support always-on mode — and have for many years. On certain Samsung devices, for example, always-on display can show the time, battery level, widgets, and more, all while the phone stays locked. Gurman expects iOS 16 to come with similar functionalities, including wallpapers with “widget-like capabilities.” Always-on display isn’t the only feature said to be exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, as past leaks indicate that Apple may only include its new A16 chip with the two premium devices. Apple is set to announce a number of other changes at its closely-approaching Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 6th. In line with previous predictions, Gurman believes that Apple could introduce enhanced windowing and multitasking features on the iPad. He cites findings from developer Steve Troughton-Smith, who recently discovered that Apple may be working on a feature that could let users freely resize windows. Apple could overhaul some of its apps as well — in addition to adding new audio features to Messages, Gurman predicts Apple will revamp its System Preferences menu to make it more like the Settings app on iOS. With WWDC a little more than a week out, we won't have to wait much longer to see how many of these predictions come true.

Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is coming to Switch,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/28/23145825/star-wars-knights-old-republic-ii-sith-lords-nintendo-switch-restored-content-dlc,"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) II: The Sith Lords is heading to the Nintendo Switch on June 8th, as announced at this year's Star Wars Celebration event. The sequel to the classic KOTOR RPG is supposed to feature some performance enhancements and resolution upgrades, as well as a Restored Content DLC set to arrive post-launch. As you might’ve guessed, the Restored Content DLC comes with the content that Obsidian Entertainment and Aspyr Media, the game’s developers, left out during their rush to launch the game in 2004. There’s already a fanmade mod for KOTOR II on Steam that restores some of this lost content, but it’s unclear how similar the official DLC will be when it comes out. You can preorder KOTOR II on the Nintendo Store for $15.00 right now, or you can buy it as part of a $29.99 bundle that also includes the original KOTOR that arrived on the Switch last year. And while Aspyr is currently working on a KOTOR remake that’s exclusive to the PlayStation 5, there’s still no word on a release date.","['kotor remake', 'official dlc', 'wars knights', 'exclusive playstation', 'upgrades restored']"
Twitter Circle may be starting to roll out to more users,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/28/23145745/twitter-circle-starting-roll-out-more-users,"Twitter started testing Circle earlier this month with a limited group, and now it looks like it’s starting to roll out to more users (via Android Police). The feature works a lot like Instagram’s Close Friends, as it allows users to send out tweets to a specific group of people rather than all of Twitter. Right now, it’s unclear how many people currently have access to Circle. It looks like more users (myself included) are finally seeing the feature pop up when they start composing a tweet, but some users still report not having access quite yet. Twitter spokesperson Joseph Nunez told The Verge it’s still in testing. “We are still currently testing Twitter Circle with a group of people across iOS, Android and Web globally,” Nunez said. “The feature has not rolled out widely to everyone yet as we continue to gather feedback.” To check if you have access to Twitter Circle, update your Twitter app or head to Twitter in a web browser. When you start composing a tweet, you’ll see a dropdown menu at the top that reads Everyone. From here, you can choose Twitter Circle to limit your tweet to a select audience, or you can hit Edit to add or remove people from your Circle. Twitter won’t notify users if you add or remove them. You can add up to 150 users to your Circle, whether they follow you or not. Users in your Circle will see a note appended to Circle-only tweets (and vice versa), stating: “Only people in @[yourusername]’s Twitter Circle can see this tweet.” Tweeting to your Circle is almost like having a private account, only it privatizes certain tweets instead of limiting access to your entire profile. The people in your Circle won’t be able to retweet anything you post to it, but they can still screenshot and download your tweets. It’s also important to keep in mind that Twitter’s community guidelines still apply even if you’re sending your tweets out to a smaller audience. Related Update May 28th, 5:27PM ET: Updated to add a statement from a Twitter spokesperson, as well as to reflect that Circle hasn’t rolled out to everyone yet.","['circle twitter', 'tweet users', 'access twitter', 'people ios', 'instagram close']"
