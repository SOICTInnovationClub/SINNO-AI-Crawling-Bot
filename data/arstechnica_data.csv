"Remembering Apple’s Newton, 30 years on",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/remembering-apples-newton-30-years-on/,"Thirty years ago, on May 29, 1992, Apple announced its most groundbreaking and revolutionary product yet, the Newton MessagePad. It was released to great fanfare a year later, but as a product, it could only be described as a flop. Widely mocked in popular culture at the time, the Newton became a poster child for expensive but useless high-tech gadgets. Even though the device improved dramatically over time, it failed to gain market share, and it was discontinued in 1997. Yet while the Newton was a failure, it galvanized Apple engineers to create something better—and in some ways led to the creation of the iPad and the iPhone. Steve Jobs, who co-founded Apple in 1976, had wooed marketing guru John Sculley away from PepsiCo to become the new Apple CEO in 1983. However, their relationship broke down, and Jobs resigned from Apple two years later after a bitter power struggle. Although Sculley made Apple profitable by cutting costs and introducing new Macintosh models, he felt lost without Apple’s visionary founder. So when Apple Fellow Alan Kay burst into Sculley’s office and warned him that “next time, we won’t have Xerox” (to borrow ideas from), he took it seriously. In 1986, Sculley commissioned a team to create two “high concept” videos for a new type of computing device that Apple could conceivably build in the future. These “Knowledge Navigator” promos showed a foldable, tablet-like device with a humanoid “virtual assistant” that interacted via spoken instructions. While some derided the impracticality of these sci-fi vignettes, they fired up Apple employees and got them thinking about the future of computing. Meanwhile, Apple engineer Steve Sakoman was bored after launching the Macintosh II. He wanted to make a portable device like the pioneering PC laptop he had built for Hewlett-Packard. To stop him from leaving Apple, vice president Jean-Louis Gassee let him set up a “skunkworks” project to pursue his dream. But he didn’t want to just make a Macintosh laptop. He had a vision of a tablet-like device, the size of a folded A4 sheet of paper, that could read people’s handwriting.                                            
Advertisement The technology to create such a device didn’t exist when the Newton project began in 1987, so Sakoman contacted AT&T and hired the company to design a low-power version of its CRISP CPU, which became known as the AT&T Hobbit. Unfortunately, the Hobbit wasn’t nearly as nimble and clever as its namesake. The CPU was “rife with bugs, ill-suited for our purposes, and overpriced,” according to Apple Chief Scientist Larry Tesler. The original Newton design required three Hobbit CPUs to operate, the end-user cost was nearing $6,000, and the device wouldn’t even be ready for at least five years. The handwriting-recognition software, a key selling point for the device, was also progressing slowly. Development of the Newton had bogged down, and Sakoman started to lose hope that it would ever be finished. In 1990, he left Apple along with Gassee to found Be, Inc., which made its own desktop computers and the BeOS operating system. At the same time, another “top secret” Apple division was also working on unique portable devices and software under the code name “Pocket Crystal."" Larry Tesler was asked to evaluate this team to see if it might be able to replace the Newton. Instead, he suggested spinning out Pocket Crystal into a separate company (which became General Magic) and refocusing the Newton project with new hardware and new leadership.","['founder apple', 'newton messagepad', 'sculley apple', 'resigned apple', 'computing apple']"
Sony accelerates push into car sector in diversification drive,https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/05/sony-accelerates-push-into-car-sector-in-diversification-drive/,"Sony expects to supply imaging sensors to 15 of the world’s top 20 global automakers by 2025, underscoring the company’s ambitions for electric vehicles and autonomous driving as it tries to diversify beyond mobile phones. The Japanese conglomerate flagged its intention to accelerate a push into the auto industry in 2020 when it unveiled a prototype EV called the Vision-S. This year, it has launched an EV division and announced a joint venture with Honda to make cars. Sony has now said it aims to provide the sensors crucial to EVs and autonomous vehicles, as it diversifies beyond making smartphone camera parts for Apple, Google, and Samsung. “We expect to be doing business in automotive imaging sensors with 75 percent of the top 20 global carmakers by financial year 2025,” said Terushi Shimizu, the head of Sony’s imaging and sensing business at a two-day event for investors that finished on Friday. The 20 automakers would make about 80 percent of cars sold globally within three years, he added. Sony plans to spend about 900 billion yen ($7 billion) to develop imaging sensors in the 2021-23 period, nearly three times as much as it spent between 2015 and 2017. One acute challenge is securing chips, as the pandemic has squeezed supply chains and sharply cut companies’ inventories. Shimizu said Sony had invested in a joint venture with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company to build a $7 billion chip factory in Japan and wanted to deepen its collaboration to secure stable supplies of logic semiconductors, which are used to control the operation of electronic devices. Akira Minamikawa, a Tokyo-based semiconductor analyst at research firm Omdia, said Sony was making advances after a stuttering start. “Sony has struggled on the car front at first, but they have been catching up. There have been problems with production capacity, but thanks to the tie-up with TSMC they are being resolved,” he added. Sony also told investors it would ratchet up the production of its PlayStation 5 console and further diversify into mobile and PC gaming. The PlayStation 5 console was launched in late 2020 and sold fewer units in its second year because of parts shortages caused by the pandemic. Analysts expect it to close that gap in the third year and overtake PS4 sales in 2024. “We’re planning on a significant ramp up in PS5 production this year, allowing us to close the gap versus PS4,” Jim Ryan, Sony’s gaming chief, told a press briefing. He added that Sony planned for “heavy further increases in console production, taking us to production levels that we’ve never achieved before”. But Ryan said supply issues were his “top priority.” pointing to risks stemming from COVID-19 lockdowns in China and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company is still betting on an economic lift from China, with hopes that PS5 sales would be driven in part by “unprecedented demand” in the world’s second-largest economy. While console titles are expected to make up more than two-thirds of releases this year, Sony intends to release nearly half of its new games on mobile or PCs by 2025, said Ryan. “Ryan dropped a few small bombs during his presentation,” said Tokyo-based gaming analyst Serkan Toto, adding that Sony’s move into mobile and PC gaming was “extremely aggressive” given the company’s modest presence on those platforms. © 2022 The Financial Times Ltd.

AMD clarifies power usage limits of its next-gen AM5 CPUs (and why that’s important),https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/amd-provides-more-details-on-how-much-power-socket-am5-cpus-will-be-able-to-use/,"AMD released some of the first details about its upcoming Ryzen 7000 processors, 600-series chipsets, and the new AM5 CPU socket earlier this week. We learned that Ryzen 7000 chips will perform at least 15 percent faster than comparable Ryzen 5000 CPUs and that they'll require DDR5 RAM. We learned that all Ryzen 7000 chips will come with integrated RDNA2-based GPUs, though AMD still plans to offer a separate line of APUs with more capable integrated graphics for people who want to play games. And we found out some details about how PCIe 5.0 support will work for SSDs and GPUs. Another bit of information AMD gave was about the AM5 socket's power limits—the amount of power an AM5 socket will be able to provide to a processor. Power limits have become more important for PC builders and enthusiasts as core counts have increased and power consumption has gone up. Some of our recent Intel CPU reviews have explored how differently the same processor can perform with different power settings, though we've also discovered that boosting performance this way can have diminishing returns (that is to say, you can double your power use without doubling your performance). AMD's processors can work similarly, though the terminology is different. Intel uses different power limits, with the PL1 value determining power usage under a sustained workload and the PL2 value determining how much power the CPU can use in short bursts (a third number, Tau, defines how long the CPU will run at that PL2 limit). AMD has a few acronyms for different power figures, but the most relevant is package power tracking (PPT). PPT is the maximum power that a CPU package can draw from the processor socket. Both Intel and AMD use thermal design power (TDP) numbers. These are related to heat output and cooling, but they usually end up being a decent proxy for sustained power usage. Socket AM4 has a 142 W PPT and supports CPUs with TDPs of up to 105 W. AMD's original announcement and press briefings made it sound like socket AM5 would support a 170 W PPT, a modest increase compared to AM4 but well short of the 241 W that Intel's LGA1700 socket can provide. On Thursday, AMD clarified to Tom's Hardware that the 170 W number refers to the maximum TDP of socket AM5 processors and that the PPT number could go as high as 230 W, which is much higher than AM4 and more in line with Intel's platform. Support for higher TDP and PPT values will have the most noticeable effect on heavily threaded workloads that run for more than a few minutes, like video encoding tasks and CPU-dependent rendering work. When we've tweaked Intel's power limits in other reviews, tests like Cinebench and our Handbrake video-encoding test show the most noticeable improvements, while more variable and single-threaded workloads like general usage and gaming don't benefit much. In short: expect the 12- and 16-core Ryzen 7000 CPUs to run faster for longer than their Ryzen 5000 equivalents, even if that means more power draw and more heat.","['am5 processors', 'pcie support', 'upcoming ryzen', 'gpus amd', 'amd plans']"
LG’s new OLED monitor is big enough to replace your TV,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/lg-launches-its-biggest-fastest-oled-monitor-yet/,"LG is already an OLED TV king, but when it comes to PC monitors, the company's OLED offerings are scant. That's changing this summer with the LG UltraGear 48GQ900 announced this week. Just like LG's other OLED monitors, you can expect this to be a lavish display for those with extreme needs and large budgets. Aimed at console and PC gamers, the 47.5-inch OLED screen will have a 4K resolution at 120 Hz (overclockable to 138 Hz) and a 0.1 ms gray-to-gray response time. Some people consider 120 Hz beneficial for watching content made at 24 fps, like movies, to avoid the judder you might get with some 60 Hz displays. All that, combined with a generous panel size, makes it easy to see the monitor being a living room TV replacement, especially for a cable-cutter. It will even come with a remote. For extreme competitive PC gaming, however, it's worth noting that you can now reserve an OLED monitor with a 240 Hz refresh rate. OLED has a reputation for generally being less bright than LED-backlit alternatives. LG didn't specify how bright the 48GQ900 will get, but it noted that the panel will use LG's proprietary anti-glare, low-reflection coating to reduce ""visual distractions."" The screen will also have 98.5 percent DCI-P3 color coverage and HDR10 support. The monitor is compatible with G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium. Both fight screen tearing when paired with an Nvidia or AMD graphics card, respectively, and you also get frame rate compensation, which allows the display to show frames multiple times if the frame rate falls below the lowest refresh rate that the monitor supports. There's also a pair of 20 W speakers, plus an audio jack that can add virtual surround sound to an attached headset via DTS Headphone:X. The port selection concludes with a pair of HDMI ports, a DisplayPort, a USB-A 3.0 upstream port, and two downstream ports. But even after the 48GQ900 comes out, those interested in the rich contrast of OLED in PC monitor form will continue to have limited options. The majority are large screens built for gamers that are overkill for most people. LG's 26.5-inch and 32-inch OLED monitors, technically aimed at businesses, continue to be some of the more accessible OLED monitors around, despite steep prices ($3,000 and $4,000, respectively). LG hasn't confirmed a US price for the LG 48GQ900 yet but said the monitor will come out in Japan this month before releasing in North America, Europe, and Asia.

"Google Drive gets multi-text selection, copy/paste shortcuts for files",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/google-drive-gets-multi-text-selection-copy-paste-shortcuts-for-files/,"The Google Workspace team is rolling out some solid productivity updates to Google Drive. You can now select multiple blocks of text at the same time in the Docs editor for quick editing. This is a feature Microsoft Word has had for a while, and it allows you to you can hold Ctrl, highlight multiple blocks of text, and apply a style. Unfortunately, Google Docs isn't using an obvious shortcut key. According to the updated shortcuts page, you'll need at least four fingers to get this done. It's Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Left/Right arrow on Windows, or  Ctrl + Cmd+ Shift + Left/Right arrow on a Mac. From there, Google says you'll need to ""use [the] left/right arrow to move to a separate section of text you also want to select."" The next dead-simple addition is keyboard shortcuts for copy/paste in the Google Drive file browser. The ability to copy and paste in the text editors has been around forever, but you'll now be able to do so in Drive's web file manager, which previously wasn't possible. It's strange that it has taken Google so long to implement this feature, but there's a lot of abstraction between you and the Google Drive JavaScript app. If you copy a Google Docs document, you aren't actually copying a file to the clipboard because the file lives on the Internet. You're moving organizational links around with a clipboard that JavaScript doesn't even have read access to. You've also always been able to install the Drive sync app and manage files through your operating system's file manager, but now the web version is getting better functionality. Both features are rolling out now. Multi-text-selection should hit everyone in about 15 days, and Drive copy/paste will take about a month.

Apple boosts employee pay as workers attempt to organize,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/apple-raises-worker-pay-amid-unionization-inflation-and-more/,"Apple plans to raise the starting pay of its hourly workers, according to a Wall Street Journal report. In the US, employees' pay will be at least $22 per hour, which could be higher in some markets. That's 45 percent higher than it was in 2018. Additionally, Apple plans to increase starting salaries for corporate workers in the United States. It will also move up some employees' annual reviews by several months to enact pay increases as soon as July. In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said: Supporting and retaining the best team members in the world enables us to deliver the best, most innovative, products and services for our customers. This year as part of our annual performance review process, we’re increasing our overall compensation budget. There are likely several reasons for this move. First, businesses of all sizes are having a harder time attracting and retaining talent in this stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Apple recently lost an AI/machine learning leader who specifically cited the company's remote work policy as a reason for his departure. Last week, the company postponed an imminent requirement to bring office workers back on-site for three days a week. Economic factors are at play, too. Inflation has been at its highest in decades, contributing to pay dissatisfaction. The recent volatility of tech stocks could also be a factor. Tech companies like Apple sometimes seek to entice workers with stock options on top of salary and other compensation, but current and prospective employees might feel less enthusiastic about stock benefits right now. Finally, retail workers at three US Apple Store locations have announced unionization plans. Some union organizers called for Apple to increase its base hourly pay.","['workers apple', 'pay increases', 'base hourly', 'apple increase', 'employees pay']"
The Google Pixel Foldable is reportedly delayed to 2023,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/the-google-pixel-foldable-is-reportedly-delayed-to-2023/,"At Google's recent I/O conference, we heard about a lot of upcoming Google hardware, including the Pixel 6a, Pixel 7, Pixel Watch, and even a Pixel Tablet, which isn't due out until sometime in 2023. We didn't hear anything about a Pixel foldable, though. Still, we know something is in the works since the Google Camera app included the detection flag ""isPixel2022Foldable"" alongside flags for other Pixel devices. So what's the deal? The Elec reports that the Google foldable is delayed until 2023. This would mark the second time the foldable has been delayed, as it was originally due out late last year. It seems that the original plan was to release the product alongside Android 12L, aka 12.1, the tablet-and-foldables-focused Android release. Google often tries to develop Android builds and new hardware simultaneously, but making hardware is difficult. Google and Samsung are partnering up for Wear OS and the Google Tensor SoC, and the Pixel foldable is likewise expected to use a lot of Samsung parts. That means a Samsung Display-made flexible OLED display on the inside, flexible ""ultra-thin glass"" for added rigidity, and a hinge from Samsung's hinge supplier. The display sizes are 7.57 inches inside and 5.78 inches outside. That's close to the Galaxy Z Fold 3 but not exactly the same. 9to5Google found simplified animations of a Google Foldable in Android 12L, and they suggest that Google's phone will open to a wider aspect ratio than Samsung's, which would put it more in line with the Oppo Find N. You can't blame Google for not wanting to rush a foldable to market. Users still regularly report cracked displays, even from Samsung's third-generation foldable; combined with the device's $1,800 price tag, that makes it a tough sell.","['pixel foldable', 'upcoming google', 'displays samsung', 'ispixel2022foldable', 'flexible oled']"
"Modular Panasonic Toughbook has 8 replaceable parts, 1,200-nit screen",https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/modular-panasonic-toughbook-has-8-replaceable-parts-1200-nit-screen/,"Pansonic's rugged Toughbook line expanded this week with the Toughbook 40. The new laptop carries many of the hallmarks of its predecessor, including military-grade durability specs and swappable parts, with some upgrades in size and display. Toughbooks have durable designs meant to withstand long drops (as much as six feet, in this case) and challenging conditions, like rain. But another standout characteristic is their modularity. The Toughbook 40 has eight parts made to be easy to repair or upgrade: the battery, RAM, storage, and keyboard, plus four expansion areas. Various types of expansion packs are available, including an optical drive, fingerprint and barcode readers, and extra I/O ports, batteries, and storage. In a FAQ (PDF), Panasonic said you can access most of the expansion areas with a screwdriver and some screws, while some only require you to use a slide lever. IT managers can lock down the SSD or expansion areas with a screw. According to Panasonic, there are 6,048 ways to build the Toughbook. At 7.4 lbs, the 14-inch Touchbook 40 is 1.2 lbs lighter than the preceding laptop, the 13.1-inch Toughbook 31. That's several pounds heavier than today's ultralight laptops, but Toughbooks are built for extreme cases, like military and law enforcement use. At 1,200 nits, the laptop's 1920×1080 touchscreen is fit to use in a sunny room or outside. Panasonic didn't specify battery life at that extreme brightness but claims that the PC can last up to 18 hours on the MobileMark 2014 benchmark and 36 hours if you get a second battery. The laptop's resistive touchpad has a 60 percent larger area, and it can be used while wearing gloves or during rain. Inside, the Toughbook 40 has up to an Intel Core i7-1185G7 with Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics (a discrete, unspecified GPU will be coming at some point). The laptop is configurable with up to 2TB of storage, upgradeable via a quick-release latch, and up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM. Additionally, there's a 5 MP webcam and the option for 4G or 5G connectivity. In Panasonic's announcement, Toughbook GM Craig Jackowski said the Toughbook 40 is the ""most rugged"" of the series. It meets the MIL-STD-810H and MIL-STD-461H military specifications and is CID2-certified for use in hazardous environments. It is IP66-certified, protecting it against dust and powerful water jets. On the security side, the laptop has an encrypted OPAL SSD with optional FIPS, TPM 2.0, Intel Hardware Shield, and Microsoft Secure-core PC. The Toughbook 40 also introduces a ""Secure Wipe"" feature that ""wipes the contents on the drive in a matter of seconds,"" according to Panasonic. Aimed at businesses and the public sector, the Toughbook 40 will start at $4,899 when it comes out in late spring, Panasonic's announcement said. If you're seeking something with a more digestible price, the 13.5-inch, DIY-friendly Framework laptop just got 12th Gen Intel CPUs.","['laptops toughbooks', 'pansonic rugged', 'touchbook 40', 'storage upgradeable', 'durability specs']"
Broadcom will pay $61 billion to become the latest company to acquire VMware,https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/05/broadcom-will-pay-61-billion-to-become-the-latest-company-to-acquire-vmware/,"Chipmaker Broadcom will be acquiring VMware for $61 billion in cash and stock, the companies announced today. Broadcom is best known for designing and selling a wide range of wired and wireless communication chips, including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips and the processors that power many routers and modems. But the company has spent billions in recent years to acquire an enterprise software portfolio—$18.9 billion for CA Technologies in 2018 and $10.7 billion for Symantec in 2019. The VMware buy is much larger than either of those purchases, but it fits the pattern of Broadcom's other software acquisitions. Once the acquisition is completed, the Broadcom Software Group will adopt the VMware name. If approved, Broadcom expects the transaction to be complete in 2023. This wouldn't be the first time someone paid a lot of money for VMware. EMC first purchased the company back in 2004 for $625 million (or just under $1 billion, adjusted for inflation). EMC itself was acquired by Dell for $67 billion in late 2015, and VMware was part of that acquisition. Dell sold many of its shares of VMware in late 2021 to help pay off debts, though Michael Dell continues to own about 40 percent of VMware's stock and remains the chairman of VMware's board. VMware makes most of its money from subscriptions to its enterprise software products, which handle the virtualization of PCs and apps, networking, and security. Ars readers may know it better for its consumer virtualization products, which include VMware Fusion for Mac and the free-for-home-use VMware Workstation Player.","['vmware buy', 'chipmaker broadcom', 'emc acquired', 'acquisition dell', 'billion symantec']"
Prominent ex-Tesla self-driving car exec leaves Apple for greener pastures,https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/prominent-ex-tesla-self-driving-car-exec-leaves-apple-for-greener-pastures/,"Apple has reportedly been working on self-driving car technology since 2014, but it has faced a series of prominent employee departures over the past year. As reported Wednesday by Bloomberg, the latest is CJ Moore, who had only just joined the company last August.  In any case, he's now moving to lidar company Luminar Technologies, which has been aggressively hiring prominent directors and executives from tech and automobile giants. At Luminar, Moore will lead the global software development for lidar-based features to ensure passengers' safety in autonomous vehicles. Bloomberg notes that ""nearly the entire Apple Car management team"" has left Apple over the past two years. The other notable departures included project lead Doug Field, who left to join Ford last year. Apple technology VP Kevin Lynch, who worked at Adobe before joining Apple in 2013, reportedly now runs Apple's car project, which is internally dubbed Project Titan. While much of Apple is focused on the iPhone and other products and services in its periphery, Project Titan is one of Apple's two largest efforts to develop a new product category that could be as successful and disruptive as the iPhone's introduction.  Both Project Titan and the mixed reality project have seen many bumps in the proverbial road, as is often the case for major new R&D projects in the tech frontier. Apple is said to be in the early stages of development for self-driving cars, but multiple recent reports have claimed that the company's first mixed reality glasses are moving toward release.","['titan apple', 'project internally', 'lidar company', 'car technology', 'cj moore']"
