Amazon is ending Cloud Cam service and offering owners a free Blink Mini,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147362/amazon-cloud-cam-shutting-down-free-blink-mini-echo-replacement,"Amazon is ending support for its Cloud Cam security camera and offering owners a free Blink Mini to replace it. MacRumors noted the change late last week, and The Verge obtained a copy of an email sent to customers announcing the change. Cloud Cam owners will be able to use their cameras and download video until December 2nd of this year, after which all recordings will be deleted and the hardware will no longer function. Customers with the Cloud Cam Key Edition will also lose the ability to connect to smart locks, although they can get a free fourth-generation Echo to replace the functionality. “As the number of Alexa smart home devices continues to grow, we are focusing efforts on Ring, Blink, and other technologies that make your home smarter and simplify your everyday routines. Therefore, we have decided to no longer continue support for Amazon Cloud Cam and its companion apps,” Amazon said in its email, which was also posted on Reddit. In a statement to MacRumors, Amazon added that “we will continue to offer innovative smart home security solutions for our customers through Amazon’s Ring and Blink brands.” It also specified that it will give Blink Mini cameras to users who are “still actively using their Cloud Cam,” although it’s not clear if that’s a formal criteria for getting the free replacement. Cloud Cam owners will be emailed instructions for redeeming their free Blink Mini and (for Key Edition owners) Echo before the December 2nd deadline. The Blink Mini will come with a one-year subscription to Blink Subscription Plus, which typically costs $10 per month or $100 per year. A subscription — either to Plus or the $3 per month single-camera Basic plan — is required for many Blink features, including rapid access to videos and motion-activated recording. Cloud Cam also required a paid subscription for advanced features, although it offered some free options that require payment on the Blink Mini. The Cloud Cam lineup launched in 2017 and wound down in late 2019 after Amazon acquired the security camera makers Blink and Ring. Now, Amazon is following a well-established pattern of companies bricking smart home hardware because they no longer want to support its ecosystem. Customers won’t be left completely without recourse thanks to the replacement — but they’ll still end up with some useless hardware that they may have bought just a few years ago."
This iPad Mini 6 case offers MagSafe-like charging capability,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23144394/pitaka-ipad-mini-6-magez-case-pro-magnetic-magsafe-charging-price-specs-features,"If you’ve wanted MagSafe-style convenient charging on an iPad Mini, Pitaka’s latest case is here for you. The new $79 MagEZ Case Pro for the sixth-generation iPad Mini (aka the iPad Mini 6) has magnetic points on the back that pass power through the iPad’s USB-C port when used with the included pad. Or you can use it with the $129 MagEZ Charging Stand, which elevates the tablet and provides a second Qi charging spot in its base for a phone or headphones. There are some downsides to this approach. Pitaka’s case doesn’t make use of the magnets built into the back of the iPad Mini, and it blocks the USB-C port from access, leaving you with the magnetic pad as the only way to charge the device. Forget about transferring any data over a wired connection while the case is on, too. The case itself is a stiff rubber with a carbon fiber-like weave pattern, which should provide protection from most average drops but isn’t the most rugged thing I’ve seen. It also doesn’t cover the screen like Apple’s folio cases, so you’ll probably want to pair it with some kind of screen protector. On the plus side, the case does allow for Apple Pencil charging on the right side, and there’s a little accessory that grabs the Pencil and holds it in place better when you toss the iPad in a bag. Those downsides aside, the MagEZ certainly lives up to the easy part of its name, as charging just requires plopping the case near the base and letting the magnets do their thing. The magnetic attraction is strong, and the stand will hold the iPad easily in either landscape or portrait orientation. (The stand also tilts, but it does not have any height adjustment.) Neither the case nor the stand comes with a charging brick, and Pitaka recommends at least a 45W USB-C Power Delivery brick if you want to charge the iPad and a phone at full speed at the same time on the stand. (The base supports 7.5W charging with iPhones or up to 15W charging with other Qi devices.) You do have to really be committed to wanting magnetic charging to make this setup worthwhile, though, as neither the case nor the stand is particularly cheap. But if that’s not a blocker for you, both accessories should be available starting today, May 30th."
Pixel Tablet could include support for third-party styluses,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147251/usi-universal-stylus-initiative-google-pixel-tablet,"Google’s upcoming Pixel Tablet might support the cross-manufacturer USI (Universal Stylus Initiative) standard, allowing it to be used with a range of third party styluses, if a recently-discovered entry in the USI’s list of certified products is to be believed. The entry, which we spotted via NuGiz, lists a device from Google with the product name “Tangor” and the model number “Tablet,” which are presumably placeholder names for the Android-powered tablet Google announced earlier this month. USI is an industry-wide stylus standard that Google joined in 2018. It’s already supported across a range of Chromebooks, allowing them to be used with a variety of styluses from different manufacturers. But while there are plenty of proprietary stylus / Android tablet offerings (like Samsung’s S Pen for its Galaxy tablets), no tablets have been certified to work with the universal USI standard. Earlier this year, the USI announced version 2.0 of the standard. This version includes a new wireless charging feature that could allow compatible styluses to be charged by simply being placed next to a supported device, similar to what Apple offers with the Apple Pencil 2 and select iPads. It’s unclear which version of the standard Google’s tablet might support. As 9to5Google notes, it seems unusual that Google’s tablet has appeared in the USI’s database this early, after Google said it’s targeting a 2023 release. According to the Wayback Machine, the listing first appeared at some point after January. Neither the USI nor Google responded to The Verge’s request for comment."
Apple’s RealityOS for rumored headset appears in trademark application,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/30/23147213/realityos-os-ros-trademark-apple-virtual-augmented-reality-headset,"RealityOS — the name Apple is reportedly using for the operating system running on its rumored virtual and augmented reality headset — has appeared in a trademark filing spotted by Parker Ortolani. Bloomberg News was first to report the “reality operating system” branding back in 2017, and references to the name have appeared in Apple’s software. The trademark application hasn’t officially been filed by Apple, but it’s common practice for large companies to apply for trademarks under one-off company names — like Realityo Systems LLC, in this case — in the state of Delaware for the sole purpose of maintaining anonymity. The trademark application is the latest evidence that Apple is on the cusp of announcing its long-rumored headset. It follows the news earlier this month that the company’s board of directors reportedly tried out the wearable device, which is common practice ahead of a public launch. In January, Bloomberg News reported that the headset was originally planned for release in late 2022 after an announcement at the company’s developer conference, but that could be delayed due to development challenges. The headset’s release could now happen in 2023, according to Bloomberg. The trademarks are also the only ones owned by this company “Realityo Systems LLC.” They were originally filed on December 8, 2021. This was just two months before “realityOS” began showing up in Apple source code. The trademark documentation references “wearable computer hardware” and is said to relate to “design and development of computer hardware, software, peripherals, and computer and video games.” The design and functionality of Apple’s headset has been the source of much speculation over the years, but most reports suggest that it’ll be able to offer a combination of virtual reality and augmented reality experiences, immersing you in virtual content as well as layering virtual elements over real world environments. It’s important to note that the RealityOS trademark hasn’t been applied for by Apple itself, and has instead been registered by a company called “Realityo Systems LLC.” But Ortolani reports that Realityo doesn’t appear to have any public presence, suggesting that it’s a shell company used by the Cupertino-based tech company to hide its involvement. Apple has reportedly taken the same approach in the past, 9to5Mac reports, using a shell company called “Yosemite Research LLC” to register macOS update names like Yosemite, Big Sur, and Monterey. The kicker? Both Realityo Systems LLC and Yosemite Research LLC are registered at the same address, which heavily implies that Apple is behind them. The RealityOS filings for a trademark and service mark don’t list any examples of the name’s use in public (meaning the product they’re associated with is yet to be released), and they’re also the only two applications associated with Realityo Systems LLC. The applications have been discovered just days before Apple is due to kick off its annual developer conference next week on June 6th, and are listed with deadlines of June 8th, leading to speculation that we could see the headset announced during Apple’s keynote. But Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman notes that the timing of the June 8th date is likely a coincidence, and coincides with a key legal deadline that comes six months after a trademark is originally filed. “Maybe we’ll see it [at WWDC],” Gurman tweeted, “but the trademark application isn’t evidence of that.”"
"For $500, you can buy the Third Sister’s 6.5-foot double-bladed lightsaber",https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/29/23146694/double-bladed-lightsaber-costs-500-star-wars-obi-wan-third-sister-reva,"Hasbro has designed a lifelike lightsaber just in time for the premiere of the new Obi-Wan Kenobi series, one that might be the toymaker’s most ambitious — and expensive — replica yet. The Black Series Reva Force FX Elite Lightsaber costs $499 and measures a total of 6.5 feet long with both blades attached. It’s modeled after the lightsaber wielded by the Third Sister, also known as Reva, a cold and callous Inquisitor set on hunting down Obi-Wan. Just like the iconic lightsabers we’ve seen held by Inquisitors in past Star Wars series, you can take off one of the blades, as well as remove half of the circle in the center of the lightsaber. There are a number of cool lighting and sound effects that you can activate too, and they work whether you’re using one or both blades. While a progressive ignition effect has the lightsaber loading up with red light in preparation for battle, a blast deflect effect eliminates lighting in particular areas of the lightsaber (complete with “pew pew” sound effects) to make it look like you’re shielding yourself from projectiles. There’s even a wall-cutting mode that turns the tip of the lightsaber bright white while emitting a buzzing sound as if you’re actually cutting through metal. Unfortunately, it does have some (expected) limitations — it doesn’t spin on its own, so you can’t use it as a sort of helicopter to propel yourself short distances or repel enemy attacks (something shown quite often in Star Wars Rebels). You’ll have to get your baton-twirling skills in order if you really want to get in on that spinning action. The Third Sister’s lightsaber looks like Hasbro’s most expensive so far, likely because of the double blades. Taking a look at Hasbro’s collection of lightsabers, the FX Force Elite replicas don’t seem to go over $300. You can check out Reva’s lightsaber for yourself on its crowdfunding page, which will almost certainly fulfill the 5,000 backer requirement (because who wouldn’t want the chance to say they have a 6.5-foot lightsaber in their home?). It’ll be available for purchase until July 11th at 11:59PM ET, but won’t start shipping until fall 2023. Correction May 30th, 8:12AM ET: A previous version of this article stated that there was a $5,000 crowdfunding requirement when it is actually a 5,000 backer requirement. We regret the error."
The Real-World AI Issue,https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18194816/ai-artificial-intelligence-issue,"The term “artificial intelligence” was coined fairly recently in 1955, but the idea of smart machines that do our bidding has far deeper roots, going back to the ancient myths of Greece, India, and China. Perhaps that’s why AI has such an impact on our imagination, and why, in recent years, there’s been so much hype surrounding the technology. But AI is not a myth, nor is it a magical machine. It’s a technology like any other, that, after decades of research, has reached a new plateau of productivity. Cheap processing power and abundant data have made this possible, and AI and machine learning are now useful tools in a diverse range of fields, including astronomy, health care, transportation, and music. After years of promise, AI is finally becoming useful. But what usually happens to useful technologies is that they disappear. We forget about the things that just work, and we shouldn’t let that happen to AI. Any technology destined to change the world needs scrutiny, and AI, with its combination of huge imaginative presence and very real, very dangerous failings, needs that scrutiny more than most. So, for the AI Issue at The Verge, we’re taking a closer look at some of the ways artificial intelligence and machine learning are affecting technology right now — because it’s too late to understand something after it’s changed the world.

"Apple can’t dismiss Cydia’s amended antitrust lawsuit, judge says",https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/29/23146529/apple-cant-dismiss-cydia-antitrust-lawsuit-judge,"Apple’s attempt to dismiss an amended antitrust lawsuit filed by the creator of Cydia, an app store for jailbroken iPhones, has failed (via Reuters). California District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers denied Apple’s motion to dismiss the case on Thursday and is giving the company 21 days to respond to Cydia’s refiled complaint. Cydia developer Jay Freeman (who also goes by the username Saurik), first filed a lawsuit against Apple in 2020. The complaint alleges Apple “has wrongfully acquired and maintained monopoly power” in iOS app distribution and payments, ultimately “depriving” third-party app stores of “the ability to compete with the App Store.” Cydia emerged before the Apple App Store even existed, and allowed users to find and download third-party apps for jailbroken devices. Freeman shut down the Cydia store in 2018. Judge Gonzalez Rogers — the same judge who issued a mixed ruling for the Epic vs. Apple trial —  dismissed the case in January, citing Freeman’s claims were outside of the four-year statute of limitations for antitrust lawsuits. Gonzalez Rogers still gave Freeman the chance to amend the complaint, which is what he did. The fresh complaint argues that from 2018 to 2021, Apple implemented “more aggressive” changes in iOS that allegedly prevented Cydia and other alternative app stores from providing “useable” apps for iPhones. Apple once again sought to shut down the refiled complaint on the basis that the allegations occurred outside the statute of limitations, but Gonzalez Rogers denied the motion for dismissal. The Verge reached out to Apple with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back. In 2020, Epic Games filed a lawsuit against Apple following Fortnite’s removal from the App Store — Apple kicked out Fornite for offering an alternate payment option, enabling Epic to get around Apple’s up to 30 percent commission it takes from in-app purchases. Epic filed a similar lawsuit against Google around the same time, which is set to go to trial in 2023. Earlier this month, Match Group, the company behind Tinder, OkCupid, and Hinge also filed a lawsuit against Google for its payment restrictions on the Play Store. In addition to app developers, Apple has been the subject of scrutiny from government agencies. While the Netherlands waged a string of fines against the company for barring Dutch dating apps from using their own billing systems, South Korea has passed a law requiring both Apple and Google to let developers incorporate third-party payment processors. The US and EU are working to clamp down on the power of large technology companies as well, with the EU set to enact the Digital Markets Act next year, and the US making progress with the Open App Markets Act designed to promote competition in mobile computing."

iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max could finally get always-on display,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/29/23146454/iphone-14-pro-max-always-on-display-apple-wwdc-rumors,"Apple may finally bring always-on display to the upcoming iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max. According to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple could introduce the feature with iOS 16, allowing the iPhone to display a limited amount of information even when it’s locked. Gurman says the iPhone’s version of always-on mode could work similarly to the way it does with the Apple Watch Series 5 and up — the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max will drop the lock screen’s frame rate with always-on mode enabled, letting them conserve energy while the display remains powered on. It’s unclear if the new iPhone will use the same low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) display Apple uses in newer Watch models. These low-powered screens play a huge part in getting always-on mode to work properly, as they're built to keep devices from consuming too much power. Last year, analysts predicted that the iPhone 13 would come with an LTPO display to enable always-on display. A number of Android devices already support always-on mode — and have for many years. On certain Samsung devices, for example, always-on display can show the time, battery level, widgets, and more, all while the phone stays locked. Gurman expects iOS 16 to come with similar functionalities, including wallpapers with “widget-like capabilities.” Always-on display isn’t the only feature said to be exclusive to the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, as past leaks indicate that Apple may only include its new A16 chip with the two premium devices. Apple is set to announce a number of other changes at its closely-approaching Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 6th. In line with previous predictions, Gurman believes that Apple could introduce enhanced windowing and multitasking features on the iPad. He cites findings from developer Steve Troughton-Smith, who recently discovered that Apple may be working on a feature that could let users freely resize windows. Apple could overhaul some of its apps as well — in addition to adding new audio features to Messages, Gurman predicts Apple will revamp its System Preferences menu to make it more like the Settings app on iOS. With WWDC a little more than a week out, we won't have to wait much longer to see how many of these predictions come true. Related"
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II is coming to Switch,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/28/23145825/star-wars-knights-old-republic-ii-sith-lords-nintendo-switch-restored-content-dlc,"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) II: The Sith Lords is heading to the Nintendo Switch on June 8th, as announced at this year's Star Wars Celebration event. The sequel to the classic KOTOR RPG is supposed to feature some performance enhancements and resolution upgrades, as well as a Restored Content DLC set to arrive post-launch. As you might’ve guessed, the Restored Content DLC comes with the content that Obsidian Entertainment and Aspyr Media, the game’s developers, left out during their rush to launch the game in 2004. There’s already a fanmade mod for KOTOR II on Steam that restores some of this lost content, but it’s unclear how similar the official DLC will be when it comes out. You can preorder KOTOR II on the Nintendo Store for $15.00 right now, or you can buy it as part of a $29.99 bundle that also includes the original KOTOR that arrived on the Switch last year. And while Aspyr is currently working on a KOTOR remake that’s exclusive to the PlayStation 5, there’s still no word on a release date."
Twitter Circle may be starting to roll out to more users,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/28/23145745/twitter-circle-starting-roll-out-more-users,"Twitter started testing Circle earlier this month with a limited group, and now it looks like it’s starting to roll out to more users (via Android Police). The feature works a lot like Instagram’s Close Friends, as it allows users to send out tweets to a specific group of people rather than all of Twitter. Right now, it’s unclear how many people currently have access to Circle. It looks like more users (myself included) are finally seeing the feature pop up when they start composing a tweet, but some users still report not having access quite yet. Twitter spokesperson Joseph Nunez told The Verge it’s still in testing. “We are still currently testing Twitter Circle with a group of people across iOS, Android and Web globally,” Nunez said. “The feature has not rolled out widely to everyone yet as we continue to gather feedback.” To check if you have access to Twitter Circle, update your Twitter app or head to Twitter in a web browser. When you start composing a tweet, you’ll see a dropdown menu at the top that reads Everyone. From here, you can choose Twitter Circle to limit your tweet to a select audience, or you can hit Edit to add or remove people from your Circle. Twitter won’t notify users if you add or remove them. You can add up to 150 users to your Circle, whether they follow you or not. Users in your Circle will see a note appended to Circle-only tweets (and vice versa), stating: “Only people in @[yourusername]’s Twitter Circle can see this tweet.” Tweeting to your Circle is almost like having a private account, only it privatizes certain tweets instead of limiting access to your entire profile. The people in your Circle won’t be able to retweet anything you post to it, but they can still screenshot and download your tweets. It’s also important to keep in mind that Twitter’s community guidelines still apply even if you’re sending your tweets out to a smaller audience. Related Update May 28th, 5:27PM ET: Updated to add a statement from a Twitter spokesperson, as well as to reflect that Circle hasn’t rolled out to everyone yet."
The new Ayn Loki handheld runs Windows and starts at $299,https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/28/23145658/ayn-loki-handheld-runs-windows-starts-299,"Ayn, the maker of the Odin Android handheld, is releasing a lineup of what it calls the “most affordable” portable Windows gaming consoles yet (via Liliputing). The cheapest of the bunch starts at just $299 — $100 less than the 64GB Steam Deck. Ayn announced the news in a YouTube video and a series of posts on Instagram, giving us a look at what we can expect for looks, tech specs, and pricing. While the entry-level $299 Loki Mini comes with 64GB of storage and an Intel Alder Lake U chip, the standard Loki handheld has an AMD Ryzen 5 6600U chip with three different storage options: 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB, each costing $499, $599, and $699, respectively. The $799 Loki Max features an upgraded AMD Ryzen 7 6800U chip and 512GB of storage. If you’re not happy with the amount of storage that comes with the device, you may be able to upgrade after purchasing it. YouTuber Taki Udon learned that each model could come with swappable storage, meaning you might have the option of giving your storage a boost if you start running out of space (via Liliputing). On the outside, it looks like the Ayn Loki inherits most of its design from the Switch-like Odin, but as Liliputing notes, it swaps a colorful set of buttons in an X, A, B, Y configuration to a solid black or white scheme with the same Y, B, A, X arrangement you’d find on an Xbox controller. There’s also a USB-C port and headphone jack on the bottom of the device. Judging by another one of Ayn’s Instagram posts, it looks like the Loki is set for release tomorrow at 9:00PM EST, and will likely be available to purchase from its website. Taki Udon also indicates that Odin owners may get access to the Loki lineup at discounted prices, but it’s unclear how much Ayn will take off. Related Ayn is just one brand attempting to take on the Steam Deck. Another company, Aya Neo,  made its first handheld gaming PC available on Indiegogo last year. It has since come out with the Aya Neo 2 and Aya Neo Slide, both of which feature the AMD Ryzen 7 6800U chip and Radeon 680M iGPU that could beat the Steam Deck on paper. Aya Neo hasn’t released pricing information on these two models yet, but they aren’t likely to be as affordable as the entry-level Loki Mini or Steam Deck — most of Aya Neo’s handhelds cost upwards of $1,000. That’s probably why Aya Neo just released the Aya Neo Air lineup, a set of lighter handhelds that start at $549 for an AMD Ryzen 5 5000U processor and 128GB of storage."
"Comcast received a patent for this smart speaker design, but will it ever be released?",https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/28/23145559/comcast-smart-speaker-patent-design-release,"Comcast has received a patent for a smart speaker — one with a very unusual design, to say the least (thanks to @SteveDonohue on Twitter for pointing this out). Instead of opting for a spherical shape that comes with the Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod Mini, or even the rounded rectangular look of the Google Nest Audio device, a sketch shows what appears to be a speaker with a sloped top and a wide base. Online records show that Comcast first filed for the patent last year, but it didn’t get approved until April 2022. As seen in the sketch, the device seems to have playback controls on the side of the speaker, with an additional button and a small stand on the bottom. At first glance, I’d say this device looks more like a router (minus the antennas) than a smart speaker, something I suppose makes sense for a company that specializes in connectivity. But after one of my colleagues said it looked like a bedpan, I just couldn’t unsee the resemblance. The funny thing is that Comcast was reportedly looking into making some sort of health-focused speaker that tracked your bathroom habits in 2019. Although it never made it into the hands (or bathrooms) of consumers, it was supposed to come with sensors that tracked how often someone got up to use the bathroom and how long they stayed in there. At the time, Comcast made sure to emphasize that it was not a smart speaker. It’s not entirely clear if these two devices are somehow related, and Comcast didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. I’m going to try my best to reserve my judgments for now — it’s still hard to tell how the smart speaker will actually look from this sketch alone. If the device is ever released, however, I’d like to see how its design translates into a tangible speaker."

This latest generation of the iPad Air looks a lot like the previous model from 2020, but it’s been given a big performance boost by borrowing the same M1 processor of the iPad Pro models and entry-level MacBooks. The Air is fast, has great battery life, and its 10.9-inch screen looks great. While it shares the same CPU as the pricier iPad Pro, it uses Touch ID built into its side button instead of Face ID and lacks ProMotion for smoother scrolling. However, this discount helps further separate the 256GB Air from the base 128GB iPad Pro which normally runs $799 — making it the better value for most people. Read our review.  The latest iPad Air retains the iPad Pro-esque redesign of the 2020 model but does away with the A14 Bionic processor in favor of Apple’s lightning-fast M1 chip. It also comes in one of five colors and boasts a 12MP front-facing camera with support for Apple’s Center Stage feature. Miraculously, if you want to buy an Xbox Series X console right now you have multiple options. You can get one at Costco or direct from Microsoft, or if you’re lucky, there might be one at your local Best Buy — but those aren’t deals. The deal du jour in the Xbox family right now is that Antonline is offering a free extra controller of your choice with the purchase of an Xbox Series S for the price of $299.99. That’s the regular selling price of the tiny console, and you get an extra gamepad valued at up to $69.99 for free. The Xbox Series S is a great little console if you don’t mind a digital-only box that tops out at 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution. Sure, it’s a little lean on storage, with 512GB built-in, but it’s perfect for Xbox Game Pass and game streaming. Plus, with this deal, you can pick from black, white, red, blue, and yellow-green controllers — even the translucent smoked-black 20th anniversary special edition (which is the right choice, by the way). This deal runs through June 7th or until sold out. Read our review. Related  The Xbox Series S is smaller than the 4K-capable Xbox Series X, but it can still tackle the same digital games — albeit at 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution. Antonline’s offer of the console with a free extra controller saves $59.99 to $69.99 depending on the chosen gamepad. If you don’t want to wait around until July for Google’s upcoming Pixel 6A and you’re a T-Mobile or Sprint customer, you can get the Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro for $150 off from Best Buy with an activation. This deal drops the price of the Pixel 6 down to $459.99 — the same as the more budget-minded 6A — and the Pixel 6 Pro is now $749.99. Both deals require an activation on T-Mobile or Sprint, but you choose to pay for them upfront or in monthly installments. While the Pixel 6 siblings have had some troubled waters with software updates, they still have some of the best cameras in a smartphone — and arguably some of the best Android phones around. The Pixel 6A will be borrowing the Google Tensor CPU when it comes out in the summer, but the improved cameras are staying exclusive to the premium Pixels. Read our review.  The Google Pixel 6 is the new base model of Google’s latest flagship. It features the Google Tensor CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a rear camera with both 50 megapixels for its main wide-angle and 12 megapixels for its ultrawide.  The Google Pixel 6 Pro is the larger sibling of the newest Pixel duo, with a 6.7-inch screen, 12GB of RAM, and a third camera featuring a 4x telephoto lens and 48 megapixels of resolution. The Lenovo Chromebook Duet has maintained its status as one of our favorite budget Chromebooks, though in late 2021, a newer model came out with a higher price tag that brought some compromises along. This new model is the Chromebook Duet 5, which got a bit fancier with a 13.3-inch OLED touchscreen and a new price point of around $500. The screen is great, the keyboard attachment is once again very good, and it’s got lengthy battery life. But it’s a bit of a different game when it’s $200 more than its predecessor. Now, you can get the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 5 for a much more respectable $379 at Best Buy. This discount of $120 for the model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD makes it much easier to overlook some of its flaws — like the lack of biometric authentication and no included pen. Money saved always makes things look better, am I right? Read our review.

How to print from a Chromebook,https://www.theverge.com/23131478/chromebook-printer-cloud-google-how-to,"While Google’s Chromebooks are all about online services, sometimes you need a good old-fashioned printout to accompany your digital adventures. Printing from a Chromebook has gotten a lot easier over the years, but it still isn’t always obvious how to get started or which paths to embrace. Follow this guide, and with any luck, you’ll be churning out paper from your cloud-centric computer in no time. [Note: unfortunately, the Cloud Print system, which made it a lot easier to print using any cloud-connected device, was relegated to the Google graveyard in 2020. This means that some older printers may not be able to print from a Chromebook, period. Before purchasing a printer, especially a used one, make sure it’s compatible with ChromeOS. Google lists some compatible printers on this page.] Provided you have a reasonably recent printer that’s capable of connecting to the internet, you should be able to add it directly to your Chromebook without the need for supplementary services. First, make sure the printer is on and connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer. The procedure for connecting a printer to Wi-Fi varies from one model to the next, but there’s generally a “Wi-Fi” or “internet” option somewhere on the printer’s display, either as an icon on the main screen or as an option in its settings menu. This should walk you through the process. Got the printer online and ready? Here’s what to do next: If your printer doesn’t appear in the list (which may happen if it’s an older device), you’ll need to click the Add printer button. If you’re using a much older printer that isn’t internet-capable, or if it is internet-capable but you’re having trouble connecting it manually as described above, don’t fret. You can connect your printer physically to a Chromebook using a USB cable. That’s it! Now just hit Ctrl-P from any browser tab or look for the Print command in any app. (Note: In the Print box that appears, you may not immediately see the name of your printer in the Destination field. If not, click in the field, and if you still don’t see your printer, click on See more... You should see your printer there.) Then prepare to print to your heart’s content. Update May 28th, 2022, 9:00AM ET: This article was originally published on April 17th, 2019, and has been updated to explain that Google eliminated its Cloud Print feature."
