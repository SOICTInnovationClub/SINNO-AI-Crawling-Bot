4 questions to ask before building a computer vision model,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/27/4-questions-to-ask-before-building-a-computer-vision-model/,"In 2015, the launch of YOLO — a high-performing computer vision model that could produce predictions for real-time object detection — started an avalanche of progress that sped up computer vision’s jump from research to market.

With lower computing costs, greater model accuracy and rapid proliferation of raw data, an increasing number of startups are turning to computer vision to find solutions to problems.

Snapchat rolls out new ‘Shared Stories’ feature to make it easier to share memories,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/27/snapchat-shared-stories-feature/,"Snapchat is rolling out a new “Shared Stories” feature that is designed to make it easier for users on the app to collaborate and share memories. The feature is a new iteration of the app’s “Custom Stories” feature, which allows users to create a story and add friends to view and contribute to it. With the new Shared Stories feature, users who have been added to a group can add their friends as well to make it easier “for the whole soccer team, camp squad, or group of coworkers to get in on the fun,” Snap says. You can start a Shared Story by heading to your profile, tapping the new story option and then selecting “Shared Story.” As with all stories sent on Snapchat, Snaps sent to a Shared Story are automatically deleted after 24 hours. However, unlike regular friend Stories and Groups, there isn’t a chat component for Shared Stories. Snapchat says content is moderated using a combination of automatic language detection and community review tools. In addition, the app will notify users if they’ve joined a Shared Story with someone they have blocked. Snapchat says this will allow users to remain in control of who they share content with on the app. ","Snapchat is rolling out a new ""Shared Stories"" feature.
