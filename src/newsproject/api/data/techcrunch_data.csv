HitPay is a one-stop solution for SMEs,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/hitpay-is-a-one-stop-solution-for-smes/,"HitPay has almost everything SMEs need to run their businesses. In addition to being an online payment gateway, it also offers tools like point-of-sale software with card readers, plugins, payment links and no-code online stores. The Y Combinator alum announced today that it has raised $15.75 million in Series A funding led by Tiger Global, with participation from returning investors Global Founders Capital and HOF Capital. It is currently used by over 10,000 merchants in Singapore and Malaysia, with plans to expand into more Southeast Asian markets, including Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. Co-founder and CEO Aditya Haripurkar told TechCrunch HitPay started in 2016 as an e-wallet but then pivoted toward being an SME-facing platform in 2018 as a virtual POS product. As its team began to understand the needs of SMEs more, it started to develop the other tools on the platform. HitPay’s Series A funding will be used for building a payments infrastructure from the ground up, with the intention of saving SMEs money and helping them expand their business. This will include business tools and payments infrastructure (including all commonly used payment rails in each market, including bank transfers, cards, e-wallets and BNPL services.) “SMEs have very specific requirements, so we wanted to build a one-stop no-code platform,” said Haripurkar. “That entails all our plugins, point of sale software, business software, online stores and recurring payments. We’ll be focusing on building these free SaaS tools in addition to building up payment rails, which are focused currently on Singaporean and Malaysian merchants. But in each country we launch in, that will look very different, so we will look at local payment methods in every country. That’s the biggest challenge for our team and where most of our investment and time is going as well.” The first step HitPay will take as it expands into new countries is to get regulated in each market it operates in, to allow it to build payment infrastructure for SMEs from the ground up. Then it will integrate the most popular payment methods. For example, in Singapore, HitPay currently works with about 10 to 15 payment methods. HitPay’s no-code platform allows SMEs to unify their online and offline payment stacks. It is typically used by medium-sized businesses, with annual revenue between $500,000 to $2 million. Most are in the retail segment, but Haripurkar expect that to evolve as well."
Zinc heads toward new $41M tech-for-good fund to back pre-team talent solving big problems,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/zinc-heads-towards-new-41m-tech-for-good-fund-to-back-pre-team-talent-solving-big-problems/,"So-called “tech for good” accelerators addressing such worthy-sounding subjects as ESGs and SDGs have appeared in the last few years. Some observers have dismissed these efforts as scalable only to a point. However, the evidence is mounting that they are increasingly attracting some of the world’s best talent, because the world’s best talent does actually want to solve some of the planet’s biggest problems. And where the talent goes, the money and backing will follow. In Europe, Entrepreneur First (EF) and Antler have tried to scale their models as “talent investors,” while the Bethnal Green Ventures fund was even acquired and recapitalized by its new owners. Clearly this approach is on something of a roll. Zinc is an accelerator that appeared back in 2017 when it was founded by Ella Goldner, Paul Kirby and Saul Klein (LocalGlobe founder) and backed by its early investors including the London School of Economics. It went on to back over 220 diverse founders who built more than 60 ventures, such as Vira Health (menopause support), Tandem (transportation for workers), Pexxi (personalized contraception pills) and Untangle (grief support). As you can see, it is indeed possible to create businesses that address what, to some, might seem like intractable problems. Zinc has now hit the first £28 million ($34 million) close of a new fund and is aiming for a final close of £33 million ($41 million) to invest in startups buildimg commercial solutions to some of society’s biggest challenges. Zinc will invest up to £250,000 in each of the companies created. Zinc 2 Fund will back talent that (similar to EF) is pre-team and pre-idea to build these startups. The cohort draws in talent focused on four missions: mental health, the environment, improving the quality of later life and helping people impacted by automation and globalization. Zinc and the entrepreneurs share a conviction that each of these missions is a big opportunity for both social impact and commercial success. Goldner, co-founder of Zinc, said in a statement: Rather than waiting for good companies to appear, Zinc helps individuals (before they have a business idea or a team) to build from scratch a new commercially ambitious company to solve the social challenge that they are most passionate about. “Typically,” she says “those individuals are 10 to 20 years into their career but are frustrated that they are not having the social impact they want … Zinc brings these groups together to combine social impact and commercial skills.” The individuals chosen by Zinc join a cohort of up to 70 people who all share the same mission and access a 12 month program of support and investment. Each of our programs has 100 Visiting Fellows and a network of partners. Givent the “Great Resignation” post pandemic, Zinc thinks it will attract those reevaluating their careers. Paul Kirby, co-founder of Zinc, says “Our missions are a call to arms: ‘Who wants to quit their jobs and spend the next decade or more solving this problem?’” Some of the examples of the founders who have built a venture with Zinc include Dr. Rebecca Love, the co-founder of Vira Health, which has raised $14 million of VC funding, and Alex Shapland Howes of Tandem, which has raised £2 million. Other investors in Zinc’s new fund include Big Society Capital, Molten Ventures, Isomer, Dunhill Medical Trust, Atomico, Anthemis Group, Taavet Hinrikus from Taaven+Sten, Illka Paannan (Supercell), Basecamp, Sarah Wood and Stuart Roden. The founders Zinc backed in its most recent venture builder program are over 50% women, 15% Black, with an average age of 38."
Max Q: Mines and metals,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/max-q-mines-and-metals/,"Hello and welcome back to Max Q. There is SO much news this week, so let’s dive in. In this issue: Don’t forget to sign up to get the free newsletter version of Max Q delivered to your inbox. Although we’ve long understood that asteroids are not simply the rubble of the universe, but potentially profitable stores of precious minerals, humanity has never been able to unlock this value. Y Combinator startup Astroforge wants to succeed where other companies have failed, by becoming the first to mine an asteroid and bring the material back to Earth — and it’s aiming to do so as early as the end of the decade. (Yes, that is not a typo — end of the decade!) To start, Astroforge will be conducting a tech demonstration mission sometime next year. The company’s already booked a spot on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission, and it has also contracted a deal with OrbAstro to manufacture the satellite. But for now, the startup is staying mum on the actual details of the payload, and how they will solve the myriad technical challenges for which asteroid mining is so notorious. “We now need to build a world-class team to go after this, as it’s a really hard problem to solve,” co-founder Matt Gialich said. Later in the conversation, he added, “That’s the fun part of startups, right? It’s a big risk until you go do it.” Near-Earth asteroid, computer artwork.

The spacecraft touched down in New Mexico on Wednesday, successfully concluding a six-day mission and the craft’s first successful test flight. As TC’s Devin Coldewey writes, even though not everything went exactly as planned, “this success may establish Boeing as a much-needed second provider of commercial ISS launch capabilities.” During a post-launch briefing, NASA commercial crew program manager Steve Stich called the landing “picture perfect.” Next up is a Crew Flight Test (CFT), which will carry astronauts and, for that reason, will be much higher stakes. The date of that launch will likely not be set for several months.

"Perceptron: Risky teleoperation, Rocket League simulation and zoologist multiplication",https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/__trashed-12/,"Research in the field of machine learning and AI, now a key technology in practically every industry and company, is far too voluminous for anyone to read it all. This column, Perceptron (previously Deep Science), aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers — particularly in, but not limited to, artificial intelligence — and explain why they matter. This week in AI, researchers discovered a method that could allow adversaries to track the movements of remotely controlled robots even when the robots’ communications are encrypted end to end. The co-authors, who hail from the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, said that their study shows adopting the best cybersecurity practices isn’t enough to stop attacks on autonomous systems. Remote control, or teleoperation, promises to enable operators to guide one or several robots from afar in a range of environments. Startups including Pollen Robotics, Beam and Tortoise have demonstrated the usefulness of teleoperated robots in grocery stores, hospitals and offices. Other companies develop remotely controlled robots for tasks like bomb disposal or surveying sites with heavy radiation. But the new research shows that teleoperation, even when supposedly “secure,” is risky in its susceptibility to surveillance. The Strathclyde co-authors describe in a paper using a neural network to infer information about what operations a remotely controlled robot is carrying out. After collecting samples of TLS-protected traffic between the robot and controller and conducting an analysis, they found that the neural network could identify movements about 60% of the time and also reconstruct “warehousing workflows” (e.g., picking up packages) with “high accuracy.” Image Credits: Shah et al. Image Credits: Shah et al. Alarming in a less immediate way is a new study from researchers at Google and the University of Michigan that explored peoples’ relationships with AI-powered systems in countries with weak legislation and “nationwide optimism” for AI. The work surveyed India-based, “financially stressed” users of instant-loan platforms that target borrowers with credit determined by risk-modeling AI. According to the co-authors, the users experienced feelings of indebtedness for the “boon” of instant loans and an obligation to accept harsh terms, overshare sensitive data and pay high fees. The researchers argue that the findings illustrate the need for greater “algorithmic accountability,” particularly where it concerns AI in financial services. “We argue that accountability is shaped by platform-user power relations and urge caution to policymakers in adopting a purely technical approach to fostering algorithmic accountability,” they wrote. “Instead, we call for situated interventions that enhance agency of users, enable meaningful transparency, reconfigure designer-user relations and prompt a critical reflection in practitioners toward wider accountability.” In less dour research, a team of scientists at TU Dortmund University, Rhine-Waal University and LIACS Universiteit Leiden in the Netherlands developed an algorithm that they claim can “solve” the game Rocket League. Motivated to find a less computationally intensive way to create game-playing AI, the team leveraged what they call a “sim-to-sim” transfer technique, which trained the AI system to perform in-game tasks like goalkeeping and striking within a stripped-down, simplified version of Rocket League. (Rocket League basically resembles indoor soccer, except with cars instead of human players in teams of three.) Image Credits: Pleines et al. Image Credits: Pleines et al. It wasn’t perfect, but the researchers’ Rocket League-playing system, managed to save nearly all shots fired its way when goalkeeping. When on the offensive, the system successfully scored 75% of shots — a respectable record. Simulators for human movements are also advancing at pace. Meta’s work on tracking and simulating human limbs has obvious applications in its AR and VR products, but it could also be used more broadly in robotics and embodied AI. Research that came out this week got a tip of the cap from none other than Mark Zuckerberg. Simulated skeleton and muscle groups in Myosuite. Image Credits: Meta Simulated skeleton and muscle groups in Myosuite. Image Credits: Meta MyoSuite simulates muscles and skeletons in 3D as they interact with objects and themselves — this is important for agents to learn how to properly hold and manipulate things without crushing or dropping them, and also in a virtual world provide realistic grips and interactions. It supposedly runs thousands of times faster on certain tasks, which lets simulated learning processes happen much quicker. “We’re going to open source these models so researchers can use them to advance the field further,” Zuck says. And they did! Lots of these simulations are agent- or object-based, but this project from MIT looks at simulating an overall system of independent agents: self-driving cars. The idea is that if you have a good amount of cars on the road, you can have them work together not just to avoid collisions but to prevent idling and unnecessary stops at lights. If you look closely, only the front cars ever really stop. Image Credits: MIT If you look closely, only the front cars ever really stop. Image Credits: MIT As you can see in the animation above, a set of autonomous vehicles communicating using V2V protocols can basically prevent all but the very front cars from stopping at all by progressively slowing down behind one another but not so much that they actually come to a halt. This sort of hypermiling behavior may seem like it doesn’t save much gas or battery, but when you scale it up to thousands or millions of cars it does make a difference — and it might be a more comfortable ride, too. Good luck getting everyone to approach the intersection perfectly spaced like that, though. Switzerland is taking a good, long look at itself — using 3D scanning tech. The country is making a huge map using UAVs equipped with lidar and other tools, but there’s a catch: The movement of the drone (deliberate and accidental) introduces error into the point map that needs to be manually corrected. Not a problem if you’re just scanning a single building but an entire country? Fortunately, a team out of EPFL is integrating an ML model directly into the lidar capture stack that can determine when an object has been scanned multiple times from different angles and use that info to line up the point map into a single cohesive mesh. This news article isn’t particularly illuminating, but the paper accompanying it goes into more detail. An example of the resulting map is visible in the video above. Lastly, in unexpected but highly pleasant AI news, a team from the University of Zurich has designed an algorithm for tracking animal behavior so zoologists don’t have to scrub through weeks of footage to find the two examples of courting dances. It’s a collaboration with the Zurich Zoo, which makes sense when you consider the following: “Our method can recognize even subtle or rare behavioral changes in research animals, such as signs of stress, anxiety or discomfort,” said lab head Mehmet Fatih Yanik. So the tool could be used both for learning and tracking behaviors in captivity, for the well-being of captive animals in zoos and for other forms of animal studies as well. They could use fewer subject animals and get more information in a shorter time, with less work by grad students poring over video files late into the night. Sounds like a win-win-win-win situation to me. Image Credits: Ella Marushenko / ETH Zurich Image Credits: Ella Marushenko / ETH Zurich Also, love the illustration."
"For remittances, crypto is still a problem looking for a solution",https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/for-remittances-crypto-is-still-a-problem-looking-for-a-solution/,"It is no secret that Andreessen Horowitz is bullish about crypto: Not only does the firm boast that it started to invest in the space a decade ago, but it also debuted a $4.5 billion web3 fund last week. To understand a16z’s bullishness despite what others have described as a “crypto winter,” its 2022 State of Crypto Report is a good start. Per its disclaimers, the document is not directed to any investors or potential investors — yada, yada, yada. But it does read like an argument for crypto, DeFi, NFTs and all things web3. The problem, in my view, is that the report’s authors, all of whom are part of a16z’s team, are overstating the current opportunity for crypto. By doing so, they are making it sound bigger than it is — and it may take years to get to that point. TechCrunch+ is having a Memorial Day sale. You can save 50% on annual subscriptions for a limited time. That the report takes an optimistic view of crypto is understandable. After all, if you are about to deploy billions in funding into a market, and you are not even alone, the TAM needs to be up to par. But the report is also meant to be an overview of trends, which is why it seems questionable to allude to opportunities that aren’t real yet. The point that bothered me the most has to do with remittances — money sent cross-border by individuals, typically from a richer country to a poorer one. The World Bank expects that such annual inflows will reach $630 billion in 2022. And yes, there are inefficiencies and fees along the way. For the authors of the a16z report, that’s more than enough to list remittances as an argument for DeFi. But are remittance payments and money transfers really ripe for crypto disruption? And is DeFi really the right solution to help what the report describes as the “huge part of the world [ … ] underserved by existing financial institutions”? That’s definitely not what I am hearing from the ground — as also confirmed by two founders I reached out to Tomás Bercovich from Global66 and Ryan Newton from Paisa. Just earlier this month, I sat in the audience of the Tech.eu Summit as Wise CEO Kristo Käärmann was interviewed on stage. “Currently, Wise doesn’t accept cryptocurrencies. Do you think,” Bloomberg’s Ivan Levingston asked him, “that this might change at some point?” This is a recurring question for the fintech company, so Käärmann made sure not to sound dismissive. “I am very excited about the technology,” he said, while also adding that “there are interesting experiments going on all around the world.” But the gist of his answer was still a nail in the crypto coffin. “We are just looking for a use case,” he said. “We’re looking for the problem that we can solve with it.”  "
Strong Compute raises $7.8M seed round to speed up ML training pipelines,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/strong-compute-raises-7-8m-seed-round-to-speed-up-ml-training-pipelines/,"Strong Compute, a Sydney, Australia-based startup that helps developers remove the bottlenecks in their machine learning training pipelines, today announced that it has raised a $7.8 million seed round. The round includes a total of 30 funds and angels, including the likes of Sequoia Capital India, Blackbird, Folklore and Skip Capital, as well as Y Combinator, Starburst Ventures and founders and engineers from companies like Cruise, Waymo, Open AI, SpaceX and Virgin Galactic. The company, which was part of Y Combinator’s Winter ’22 batch, promises that its optimizations can speed up the training process by 10x to 1,000x, depending on the model, pipeline and framework. As Strong Compute founder Ben Sand, who previously also co-founded AR company Meta, told me, the team has recently made some breakthroughs where it was able to make Nvidia’s reference implementation, which its customer LayerJot used, run 20 times faster. Image Credits: Strong Compute Image Credits: Strong Compute “That was a big win,” Sand said. “It really gave us the sense that there is nothing that can’t be improved.” He didn’t quite want to reveal all of the details of how the team’s optimizations worked, but he noted that the company is now hiring mathematicians and is building tools that give it a more detailed view of how their user’s code interacts with the CPUs and GPUs at a much deeper level than was previously possible. As Sand stressed, the current focus for the company is to start automating a lot of the current work to optimize the training process — and that’s something the company can now tackle, thanks to this funding round. “Our goal now is to have serious development partners in self-driving, medical and aerial, in order to be looking at what is actually going to generalize really well,” he explained. “We’ve now got the resources to have an R&D team that doesn’t have to deliver something in a two-week sprint but that can actually look at what’s some real core tech that could take a year to actually get a win out of but that can really help with that automated analysis of the problem.” Strong Compute wants to speed up your ML model training  The company currently has six full-time engineers but Sands plans to double that over the next few months. In part, that’s also because the company is now getting inbound interest from large companies that often spend $50 million or more on their compute resources (and Sands noted that the market is basically bimodal, with customers either spending less than $1 million or $10 million to $100 million, with only a few players in the middle). Image Credits: Strong Compute Image Credits: Strong Compute Every company that is trying to build ML models, though, suffers from the same problem: training models and running experiments to improve them still takes a lot of time. That means the well-paid data scientists working on these problems spend a lot of time in a holding pattern, waiting for results to come in. “Strong Compute is solving the basketball court problem,” said SteadyMD CFO Nikhil Abraham. “Long training times had our best devs shooting hoops all day, waiting on machines.” And while some of that inbound interest is coming from the financial industry and companies that want to optimize their natural language processing models, Strong Compute’s focus remains on computer vision for the time being. “We’ve only just scratched the surface of what machine learning and AI can do.” said Folklore partner Tanisha Banaszczyk. “We love working with founders who have long-range ambition and visions that will endure across generations. Having invested in autonomous driving, we know how important speed to market is — and see the impact Strong Compute can have on this market with its purpose-built platform, deep understanding of the $500 billion market and world-class team.”"
SWVL plans to lay off 32% of its team two months after going public,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/swvl-plans-to-lay-off-32-of-its-team-two-months-after-going-public/,"Egypt-born and Dubai-headquartered mobility startup SWVL is planning to lay off 32% of its workforce it said in a statement today. The company’s LinkedIn profile shows it has over 1,330 employees. Letting go of over 30% of its workforce means that around 400 people will lose their jobs at the mobility company. Tech companies, private and public, have faced a reckoning in the past few months with their valuations taking a beating. The effect of an economic downturn has also affected their finances leading them to cut costs; the top of the list is letting go of employees. This downsizing from the Dubai-based startup adds to the long list of global cross-stage layoffs in what has been a rough month for tech employees. Over 15,000 tech workers have lost their jobs in the U.S. alone according to reports. Companies such as Klarna, Getir, Gorillas and Bolt have dismissed portions of their workforce while the likes of Snap, Twitter and Instacart have slowed down hiring entirely. It’s been a very busy 18 months for SWVL leading up to this news. This March, the company went public via a SPAC merger with U.S. women-led blank check company Queen’s Gambit Growth Capital. It listed at $10 per share and targeted a $1.5 billion valuation but has traded between $4 and $8 for the most part. Its current valuation hovers around $500-$600 million. All eyes are on Swvl as it starts trading on a SPAC combination  The layoffs are coming just a month after SWVL acquired U.K.-based mass transit group Zeelo for $100 million according to sources. It’s one of five acquisitions SWVL has made within the past year; others include Germany’s door2door, Turkey’s Voltlines (for ~$40 million), Spain’s Shotl and Argentina’s Viapool. SWVL said that though these acquisitions have contributed to its overall growth, it will need to make reductions on roles automated by investments in its engineering and product and support functions teams. “The planned layoffs will impact teams responsible for functions that have been automated following investment in engineering, product and support functions,” SWVL said in a statement. SWVL said it plans to attain profitability next year. Dismissing hundreds of employees is one way to get there. Others include developing its proprietary technology stack and growing its three models — where it makes $5 million in MRR — across existing and new markets, it said in a statement. SWVL is present in 13 markets globally: the UAE, Egypt, Kenya, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Turkey, Japan, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Pakistan. According to a source, the majority of the layoffs will come from the company’s Dubai and Pakistan offices. Whether SWVL will continue its expansion into new markets such as Colombia, Mexico and South Africa, and the U.S. — announced during its SPAC merger — is uncertain. “As a result of the portfolio optimization program, Swvl’s management currently expects that the company will be cash-flow positive in 2023.” CEO Mostafa Kandil sent out a letter to his employees addressing the layoffs. Here’s a part of it: Become Free Cash Flow Profitable in 2023 – Swvl is implementing a portfolio optimization program to focus on its highest profitability operations, enhance efficiency and reduce central costs – Capitalizes on the highest profitability operations TaaS and SaaS which currently have > 500 contracts in > 10 countries generating > $5m revenue per month – B2C business is also expected to be contribution margin positive before the end of 2022 – Builds on recent acquisitions of TaaS and SaaS businesses Viapool, Volt Lines, Shotl and pending acquisition of door2door which improve profitability margins – Benefits from a world class engineering and product team and technology stack which allows for scalability and sustainable growth Resources No matter how big, resources are not infinite; cash is meant to be responsibly utilized. We need to be as disciplined as ever, which is why today, May 30, 2022, we announced that our portfolio optimization program to turn cash flow positive in 2023. As part of that program, we have considered various scenarios that will allow us to demonstrate how much we value our workforce. We believe that Swvl has reached such a level of success only because of the team, and we are also sure that Swvl will continue to get stronger. What we did: – Voluntary salary deductions from the top management team – Reduction of current office spaces – Freezing our current hiring program – Freezing travel and accommodation expenses – Tying expenditures to essential business requirements People Effective today, May 30, 2022, we are optimizing our operations in some of our markets while reducing our workforce. The reduction follows an extensive evaluation of team redundancy and how this complements our strategy. We have arranged for one-to-one communications with all of the impacted teammates. Each member of the reduced workforce will receive an invitation to have a conversation with a relevant senior leader to receive clarity on the next steps based on each market’s local laws, severance rules, and best practices. To those who will leave, I would like to say I am sorry. And more importantly, this is not your fault. You will forever be part of Swvl, and our door will always be open to you in the future. We are incredibly lucky and grateful to have worked with such remarkable talent that many companies would be fortunate to have. Besides your work, what will stay with us is knowing that we genuinely did hire people better than us. I am sure you will continue to have a significant impact wherever you go, as you have done day in and day out at Swvl. Easing the transition for impacted employees: – Severance: All impacted employees to receive severance based on gross salary and complete cash payout – Provident Fund, Gratuity & Leave encashment other legal payments – All RSU to be considered vested – Expense claims/OPD claims to be cleared – All Final Settlements to be taxed as per local requirement – Payout Transfer to be complete in the next 21 days Medical Insurance: to be extended for all entitled employees Stock Options: all unvested stocks for impacted employees to continue to vest as per schedule Alumni Directory: an alumni network directory to support our impacted workforce No interview policy for Rejoiners Laptops to be retained by employees subject to data security requirements Update: In an email to TechCrunch, CFO Youssef Salem said Swvl is not shutting down operations in any country whether from its existing footprint or planned expansions but rather optimizing its network and headcount in each country."
Mintlify taps AI to automatically generate documentation from code,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/mintlify-taps-ai-to-automatically-generate-documentation-from-code/,"Mintlify, a startup developing software to automate software documentation tasks, today announced that it raised $2.8 million in a seed round led by by Bain Capital Ventures with participation from TwentyTwo Ventures and Quinn Slack, Sourcegraph’s co-founder. CEO Han Wang says that the proceeds will be put toward product development and doubling Mintlify’s core three-person team by the end of the year. Ithaca, New York-based Mintlify was co-founded in 2021 by Han Wang and Hahnbee Lee — both software engineers by trade. Wang previously co-launched Foodful, a startup that developed a cloud-based monitoring system for cows, and Pe•ple, an online customer community platform that was acquired by Tribe in early 2021. Lee was a co-founder at Pe•ple before briefly joining Duolingo as an engineer. Wang said the idea for Mintlify came from his and Lee’s experiences in software development, which involved working with documentation that wasn’t always complete or of the highest quality. Their observations agree with a 2017 GitHub survey, which found that 93% of developers consider incomplete or outdated documentation to be a pervasive problem. “We’ve worked as software engineers at companies in all stages ranging from startups to Big Tech and found that they all suffer from bad documentation, if it even existed at all,” Wang told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Documentation is the lifeline for junior engineers and those jumping into new codebases. It helps senior devs save time from explaining their code to others in the future. For public-facing and open source products, documentation has a direct impact on user adoption.” Image Credits: Mintlify Image Credits: Mintlify Mintlify aims to address the challenges around documentation with automation, specifically auto-generating documentation. The company’s platform reads code and creates docs to explain it, leveraging technologies including natural language processing and web scraping. Wang declined to reveal more about Mintlify’s technical underpinnings, but generating documentation from code is well within the realm of possibility with today’s AI techniques. That’s evidenced by the fact that Mintlify has several competitors taking similar approaches, including Documatic, whose AI system automatically generates change logs and explanations from code in addition to documentation. Wang asserts that Mintlify provides “significantly” higher quality results than its rivals, and — unlike some — doesn’t force developers to host documentation on a cloud service. “Mintlify’s mission is to solve documentation rot by developing continuous documentation into a standard practice for software teams,” Wang added. “[W]hen engineering managers are actively seeking solutions for better documentation practices … that’s when we step in.” Beyond generating documentation, Mintlify routinely scans for “stale” documentation and detects how users engage with the documentation to improve its readability. (Wang emphasized that the platform doesn’t store code and encrypts all user data at rest and in transit.) Mintlify, which is free for individual developers, also integrates with existing systems including Slack, Dropbox and GitHub for automating task management and development workflows. According to Wang, adoption of Mintlify’s free plan has been growing 20% every week since its January launch. With the user base now eclipsing 6,000 active accounts, the company plans to shift its focus to a premium offering oriented toward enterprise customers. “The pandemic standardized a decentralized and asynchronous work environment. This made high-quality documentation critical to achieving efficient communication, onboarding and product development,” Wang said. “Our expansion into workflow automations is addressing the challenge by targeting the engineering managers with our existing fanbase serving as champions.”"
"The Station: EV SPACs face new regulatory speed bump, more on Rivian’s reorg and VW weighs direct sales for Scout brand",https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/the-station-ev-spacs-face-new-regulatory-speed-bump-more-on-rivians-reorg-and-vw-weighs-direct-sales-for-scout-brand/,"Welcome back to The Station, your weekly guide to everything going on in the world of transportation. Many readers of this weekly newsletter are likely enjoying a three-day weekend thanks to the Memorial Day holiday. So, this week I will keep it a wee bit shorter. Before we get started, check out the latest transportation Q&A, this time with Convoy co-founder and CEO Dan Lewis. He predicts digital freight will go mainstream within the year. Why? Lewis said: “The industry is going to contract differently. Brokers are going to think about digital capacity and how they get access to that; they’re going to be comfortable using a platform like Convoy for that.” As always, you can email kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com or rebecca.techcrunch@gmail.com to share thoughts, criticisms, opinions or tips.

A new report from the U.K. Department for Transportation revealed that the number of pedestrians injured after being hit by e-scooters was nearly four times higher in 2021, at 223 people, than in 2020 when 57 people were injured. Seeing as how it’s still illegal in the U.K. for people to ride private e-scooters, most of these injuries occurred with vehicles from shared micromobility schemes. The report doesn’t say where these accidents occurred — were scooter riders on the sidewalk, and if so, are there protected bike lanes on the street where the accidents occurred? PeopleForBikes, in partnership with Wend Collective, released a report celebrating the milestones of certain U.S. cities that have systematically increased bike mobility by following the organization’s grassroots effort strategy. Here are some of the highlights:
• Austin, Texas: Completed 115 miles of new bike lanes in 24 months and secured another $460 million to complete the network by 2025.
 • Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: Completed 50 new network miles and plans to build another 15 miles in 2022.
• Providence, Rhode Island: Constructed 43 miles of new bikeways under the Great Streets Initiative, with another 22 miles planned for this year.
• New Orleans, Louisiana: Constructed 27 miles of new “high comfort” bikeways in underserved areas. Offered highest concentration of new protected bike lanes of any other city in the program.
• Denver, Colorado: Constructed 100 miles of new bikeways with another 50 miles of community-based networks scheduled for 2022. A BCG survey predicts subscription will be the fastest-growing area of micromobility this decade. Self-combusting micromobility vehicles are getting more abundant. Serial 1 has released its new BASH/MTN e-bike, a single-speed, small-batch production bike where minimalism meets off-road adventure. Squad Mobility launched preorders for its Solar City Car, a two-seater compact city car that charges itself, in part, on solar energy. The car will be available in 2023 from €6,250. See ya next week! — Rebecca Bellan Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Perhaps you saw coverage of a leaked internal email, first viewed by Bloomberg, from Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe that detailed changes among some of its higher profile leaders at the company. Initial reports, including ours, focused on Rivian hiring Frank Klein as its new chief operating officer. Klein will join the company June 1 to oversee the automaker’s production, manufacturing engineering and supply chain. The automaker also said its head of manufacturing engineering, Charly Mwangi, is leaving the company. I finally got my hands on the complete internal email and there are a few other changes worth noting. Rivian is dividing its commercial business with one group focused on its B2B vertical and the other on its B2C vertical. Chief Growth Officer Jiten Behl will focus on the B2B business, which includes commercial vans, Rivian’s fleet management software FleetOS, charging and importantly, its relationship with Amazon. (And that makes sense considering Behl is largely responsible for Rivian’s relationship with Amazon.) Behl, who will report directly to Scaringe, will also oversee strategy and corporate development, which includes strategic partnerships, business development activities and launching in international markets. Rivian has launched a job search for a chief commercial officer to lead its B2C business. Rivian is also changing up its marketing, brands and comms team a bit. The brand team led by Forest Young and the communications team, led by Nick Mulholland, will now report directly to Scaringe. The marketing team, led by Lindsey Pearl, will be join the communications team. Then over in manufacturing and operations is the new COO I noted above. Under Klein will be several executives including Tim Fallon, who heads up manufacturing operations; Michael Smith, who is VP of quality; and Steve Gawronski, who is VP of supply chain. The manufacturing engineering spot, which Mwangi previously held until resigning, will also move under the COO. Finally, Jimmy Knauf, the executive VP of facilities, and Rivian’s entire facilities team will join the CFO organization and report directly to Claire McDonough. Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Just a roundup this week, folks! American Axle and Manufacturing Holdings is exploring a potential sale, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Detroit-based auto-parts supplier has already hired an adviser to help with the process and a leveraged buyout through a private equity firm is a likely option. Battery Ventures, the U.S. private equity firm, made a A$657.6 million ($466.76 million) preliminary buyout offer for Australia-based automotive software provider Infomedia, Reuters reported. The A$1.75 in cash per Infomedia share bid is five Australian cents more than the rival proposal from a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm TA Associates. Booster, the on-demand direct-to-fuels delivery startup, raised more than $125 million in Series D funding led by Rose Park Advisors with participation from new investors Chaac Ventures, Equinor Ventures, Mitsubishi Corporation and Thayer Ventures. Renewable Energy Group, a producer of low-carbon renewable fuels, also increased its strategic investment. Existing investors Cercano Management, Conversion Capital, Enterprise Holding Ventures, Invus Opportunities, Madrona Venture Group, Maveron Ventures, Perot Jain LP and Version One Ventures also participated. BMW i Ventures led an undisclosed investment in the Series A-1 financing round of Mangrove Lithium. BMW i Ventures was joined by existing investor Breakthrough Energy Ventures in the round. Caribou, the auto financing and insurance platform, raised $115 million in Series C funding led by Goldman Sachs. The funding has pushed the fintech company’s valuation past the $1 billion mark. Other investors in the round included Innovius Capital, Harmonic, Accomplice, CMFG Ventures, Curql Collective, Firebolt Ventures, Gaingels, Moderne Ventures and Motley Fool Ventures. Finn, the car subscription startup, raised $110 million in a Series B round led by Korelya Capital along with Keen Venture Partners, Climb Ventures, Greentrail Capital and Waterfall Asset Management. Existing investors such as White Star Capital, HV Capital, Heartcore Capital, UVC Partners and Picus Capital also participated in the round. The funds will be used to help Finn expand in the U.S. and Europe and reach 30,000 subscriptions by the end of the year. Johnson Matthey agreed to most of its battery material unit to Australia’s EV Metals Group for £50 million ($63.15 million), reported the Financial Times. Meanwhile, Johnson Matthey sold its battery materials unit in Canada to Nano One for C$10.25 million ($8.05 million). Meritor announced last week (I missed this one) that it agreed to acquire Siemens’s 200-person Commercial Vehicles business for approximately €190 million ($203.9 million) in cash. Motive, the fleet management software startup that formerly known as KeepTruckin, raised $150 million in series F funding round co-led by Insight Partners and Kleiner Perkins. Motive’s post-funding valuation is now $2.85 billion, according to the company. Natrion, a solid-state battery technology startup founded in 2019, raised $2 million in seed funding ed by Chicago-based TechNexus Venture Collaborative with participation from Tamarack Global, Mark Cuban, Illinois Ventures and other private investors. Nowports, an automated digital freight forwarder in Latin America, raised $150 million in a Series C funding round led by SoftBank Latin America Fund. The raise, which pushes its post-funding valuation to $1.1 billion, comes just six months after the Monterey, Mexico-based startup announced it had secured $60 million in a Series B funding round led by Tiger Global Management. Roetz, a Dutch e-bike maker, has raised $1.9 million from from Veth Investments and entrepreneurs Pim Claassen and Alexander van Citters. Sylndr, the Cairo-based online used car startu, raised a pre-seed round of $12.6 million — the largest of its kind in MENA and sub-Saharan Africa. Saudi-based early-stage venture capital firm RAED Ventures led the round. VC firms Algebra Ventures, Nuwa Capital, 1984 Ventures and Global Founders Capital participated, with several regional and global angel investors taking part as well. United Gear & Assembly, a maker of high-precision gears for EVs and other industries, has agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Aesther Healthcare Acquisition Corp. United Gear, a subsidiary of United Star Holdings, designs and makes high-precision gears for multiple large-end markets and its customers include Allison Transmission, Caterpillar, GM, Ingersol Rand, John Deere, Lucid Group, Toyota and Volvo. Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch Image Credits: Bryce Durbin/TechCrunch The IEEE Standards Association, which focuses on autonomous vehicle (AV) safety, released a new standard called IEEE 2846-2022 Standard for Assumptions for Models in Safety-Related Automated Vehicle Behavior. The association says this is a technology-neutral safety standard that scholars, engineers, automakers, industry representatives and regulatory bodies can align around as a universally accepted basis for AV safety. Pony.ai’s permit to test its autonomous vehicle technology with a driver was revoked by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. The agency, which regulates AV testing in the state, pulled the permit because Pony.ai failed to monitor the driving records of the safety drivers on its testing permit. Pony confirmed the revocation of its permit to TechCrunch, saying the DMV took issue with the driving records of three of its safety operators. EV SPACs — and actually all SPACs — are facing a new regulatory speed bump, TC’s Jaclyn Trop reports. Hyundai plans to invest more than $10 billion toward accelerating electrification and autonomous vehicle technology in the U.S. by 2025. Stellantis and Samsung SDI will team up to build a $2.5 billion lithium-ion battery plant in Indiana. The project, which will create 1,400 new jobs and could surpass the $3 billion mark once it’s complete, is Stellantis’ first battery plant in the U.S. and its fifth worldwide. Tesla lost an effort to keep a sexual harassment suit within closed-door arbitration. A judge rejected Tesla’s motion and ruled it can proceed in court. VW Group CEO Herbert Diess made an interesting comment to me about the sales model of the new Scout EV brand during my interview with him for TC Sessions: Mobility 2022. You can watch the entire interview here. It wasn’t so much what he said but what he didn’t. When I asked if the Scout brand would use a direct-to-consumer sales model or sell its EVs through dealerships, Diess played coy. That’s interesting because generally legacy automakers are lightning quick to stick to the we-will-always-use-dealerships line. Diess told me that “the company will need to reconsider what is the right franchise for it or is there a franchise for it?” That line has U.S. dealerships freaking out.

One AI raises $8M to curate business-specific NLP models,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/one-ai-raises-8m-to-curate-business-specific-nlp-models/,"Whether to power translation to document summarization, enterprises are increasing their investments in natural language processing (NLP) technologies. According to a 2021 survey from John Snow Labs and Gradient Flow, 60% of tech leaders indicated that their NLP budgets grew by at least 10% compared to 2020, while a third said that spending climbed by more than 30%. It’s a fiercely competitive market. Beyond well-resourced startups like OpenAI, Cohere, AI21 Labs and Hugging Face and tech giants including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, there’s a new crop of vendors building NLP services on top of open source AI models. But Yochai Levi isn’t discouraged. He’s one of the co-founders of One AI, an NLP platform that today emerged from stealth with $8 million led by Ariel Maislos, Tech Aviv, Sentinel One CEO Tomer Wiengarten and other unnamed venture firms and angel investors.  “While the market is growing fast, advanced NLP is still used mainly by expert researchers, Big Tech and governments,” Levi told TechCrunch via email. “We believe that the technology is nearing its maturity point, and after building NLP from scratch several times in the past, we decided it was time to productize it and make it available for every developer.” Image Credits: One AI Image Credits: One AI Levi lays out what he believes are the major challenges plaguing NLP development. It’s often difficult to curate open source models, he argues, because they have to be matched both to the right domain and task. For example, a text-generating model trained to classify medical records would be a poor fit for an app designed to create advertisements. Moreover, models need to be constantly retrained with new data — lest they become “stale.” Case in point, OpenAI’s GPT-3 responds to the question “Who’s the president of the U.S.?” with the answer “Donald Trump” because it was trained on data from before the 2020 election. Levi believes the solution is a package of NLP models trained for particular business use cases — in other words, One AI’s product. He teamed up with CEO Amit Ben, CPO Aviv Dror and CSO Asi Sheffer in 2021 to pursue the idea. Ben previously was the head of AI at LogMeIn after the company acquired his second startup, Nanorep, an AI and chatbot vendor. Dror helped to co-found Nanorep and served as a platform product manager at Wix. Sheffer, a former data scientist at Nanorep, was the principal data scientist at LogMeIn. As for Levi, he was the VP of online marketing at LivePerson and the head of marketing at WeWork. One AI offers a set of models that can be mixed and matched in a pipeline to process text via a single API call. Each model is selected and trained for its applicability to the enterprise, Levi said, and automatically matched by the platform to a customer’s task and domain (e.g., conversation summarization, sales insights, topic detection and proofreading). One AI’s models can also be combined with open source and proprietary models to extend One AI’s capabilities. The platform’s API accepts text, voice and video inputs of various formats. With One AI’s language studio, users can experiment with the APIs and generate calls to use in code. “With the maturation of Language AI technologies, it is finally time for machines to start adapting to us,” Ben told TechCrunch via email. “The adoption of language comprehension tools by the broader developer community is the way to get there.” Image Credits: One AI Image Credits: One AI One AI prices its NLP service across several tiers, including a free tier that includes processing for up to one million words a month. The stackable “growth tier” adds 100,000 words for $1. The hurdle One AI will have to overcome is convincing customers that its services are more attractive than what’s already out there. In April, OpenAI said that tens of thousands of developers were using GPT-3 via its API to generate words for over 300 apps. But, with Fortune Business Insights pegging the NLP market at $16.53 billion in 2020, it could be argued that there’s a large enough slice of the pie for newcomers. Added TehAviv founder and managing partner Yaron Samid: “Language is the most valuable untapped resource, beyond the reach of most products and companies. This is true to most industries and domains and results in negative outcomes that include everything from lost sales to lower levels of user engagement and loyalty to reputation damage. Unleashing Language AI allows us to harness the power of this unstructured data and turn it into useful information and insights.” One AI says that a portion of the seed round proceeds will be put toward expanding its 22-person team, which includes 10 NLP data scientists."
Ayoken raises $1.4M to grow its NFT marketplace for creatives,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/ayoken-raises-1-4m-to-grow-its-nft-marketplace-for-creatives/,"Ayoken, an NFT marketplace for creatives, has raised $1.4 million pre-seed funding to enable users grow their revenue streams through digital collectibles. The startup’s marketplace, Ayokenlabs, will feature digital collectibles from musicians, sports brands and influencers from all over the world. Ayoken founder and CEO, Joshua King, told TechCrunch that the marketplace is a bridge between fans and artists, and gives supporters a sense of ownership in the success of their idols. Through the NFT marketplace, he said, fans will have access to tokens such as behind-the-scenes videos and album art. NFT holders will also get other perks like access to unreleased music and exclusive live events by the creatives. “Through VIP passes, fans will get the ability to actually livestream music by these artists before it arrives on Spotify, YouTube or Apple Music. Fans will get discounts for future events too,” said King, who has 14 years’ experience in strategy, growth and innovation consultancy, and entrepreneurship. His career includes helping scale AZA (Bitpesa), a Nairobi-based platform that leverages bitcoin to facilitate cross-border remittances and where he first got introduced to crypto and blockchain technology. MARA raises $23M from Coinbase Ventures and FTX to build Africa’s portal to the crypto economy  King said Ayoken will over the next few months release NFTs of some major African artists and others across the world. The London-headquartered startup has already partnered with Ghanaian afrobeats artist KiDi (Dennis Nana Dwamena) for his first NFT drop on the first day of June. King said the cross-chain marketplace (although currently built on Avalanche blockchain) allows crypto and card payments but plans to add mobile money as the startup makes it easier for people in emerging markets like Africa to trade with ease. King said they are negotiating partnerships with a number of telcos in the continent to make this a reality. “We are reducing friction points for the users by letting people use their cards instead of having to use crypto to buy; we are working on partnerships with telcos that will allow people to use mobile money to make the payment in future too. Nothing comes close to what we are doing and that is why we are able to sign some of the biggest names in the creative industry,” he said. Users will get token (Ayo) rewards when they buy the NFTs or refer people, which they can redeem later for an NFT. King said, unlike other NFT marketplaces, they have distribution partners including YouTubers, influencers, newsletters, crypto exchanges and telecoms to promote NFT drops — allowing the creatives to tap a wider audience and not just their fanbase. “What this means is that celebrities do not have to rely on their social media following to drive transactions. They get instant access to millions of people all around the world at the touch of a button. And our approach is so different to any other NFC marketplace on the planet. We also have a marketing agency to help these creatives succeed in their first NFT drops,” said King. “They (distribution partners) will get a revenue share based on any transactions generated on their social media promotions.” Using the funds raised from the investors, among them Founders Factory Africa, Texas-based Kon Ventures, Europe-based venture capital collective Crypto League, Ghana-based R9C Ventures and Maximus Ventures, Ayoken plans to sign a number of exclusive deals with artists and partnerships with telcos, besides growing its team and secondary marketplaces. “A majority of the funding will go into buying exclusive licenses and into building our tech team; that is the developers and engineers by fourfold,” he said. eBay launches its first collection of NFTs in partnership with web3 platform OneOf  Coinbase’s NFT marketplace is off to a lackluster start "
"Betastore gets $2.5M to solve stockouts, financing challenges for informal retailers in West and Central Africa",https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/30/betastore-gets-2-5m-to-solve-stock-outs-financing-challenges-for-informal-retailers-in-west-and-central-africa/,"About 80% of household retail in sub-Saharan Africa is delivered through informal channels, which perennially face several challenges like stockouts, leading to an instability in earnings and a lack of attractiveness to financiers. These challenges befall millions of microretailers across the continent, and Betastore, a B2B retail marketplace for informal retailers, is working to resolve in Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Senegal. The Betastore marketplace enables informal traders to source fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) directly from manufacturers or distributors — which keeps the prices of the products competitive by eliminating interactions with sales agents. It also works with logistics partners to ensure the delivery of goods within 24 hours. The Nigeria-based startup plans to provide these services beyond its current three markets by expanding to Ghana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon by the end of this year, after closing $2.5 million in pre-series A funding from 500 Global, VestedWorld and Loyal VC. Betastore has to date raised $3 million in funding. “What is really important for us is to be able to continue to scale by leveraging our asset-light model. We plan to enter new markets before the end of the year and to expand to 100 cities across Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Senegal. We are also planning to reinforce our technology and leadership teams and to bring in new products and to improve existing ones,” said Betastore CEO, Steve Dakayi-Kamga, who co-founded the startup with Leo-Armel Tchoudjang mid 2020. MarketForce raises $40 million Series A, introduces BNPL merchant stock financing  The asset-light model means Betastore does not have any capital and labor intensive assets like warehouses or its own fleet of vehicles for delivery. Dakayi-Kamga said that this has helped the startup to optimize its technology to ensure that retailers source goods from the closest distributors. On average, a retailer using Betastore makes 4.4 orders per month. “Our technology enables retailers to order on demand, access a variety of products and solves logistics headaches for them too. With Betastore, they don’t have to close their shops to go get goods from distributors stores or the market, and do not have to lose close to half of the margins in in the logistics,” said Dakayi-Kamga, who previously worked for Jumia, where he led the e-commerce platform’s logistics, warehousing and marketplace fulfillment department. The B2B e-commerce platform is set to introduce financing in July, a launch that follows a pilot program involving 200 retailers that the startup carried out last year. The BNPL financing strategy, Tchoudjang says, will be based on retailers’ sales and will go a long way in helping them to grow the value of their shopping baskets and ultimately their businesses. The startup plans to charge an interest based on product margins. Betastore is currently integrating its technology into a network of financing partners including fintechs and banks. “The mandate of some of the partners we have on board is to support the economy by financing small businesses but are not able to lend to them because they do not have the data to inform decisions. We have the visibility of what is happening in this sector and have data they can use to extend financing,” said Tchoudjang, who previously held executive and leadership roles within the IFC-backed AccessHolding AG network in Africa. He has also helped multinationals rollout fintech and microfinance products for emerging markets in the past. Namibian B2B e-commerce retail platform JABU raises $15M led by Tiger Global  Retailers use the Betastore wallet to repay loans, deposit money for their operations and to send, receive and save money. “The wallet helps them separate their business money from their own money, and it is directly connected to the whole banking system, meaning that retailers can receive and send money to any bank and load cash with any agency banking platform,” said Tchoudjang. Since launch, the startup claims to have grown its customer base and revenues by 10 and 12 times, respectively. The startup anticipates greater growth especially after entering more countries and rolling out its buy now, pay later (BNPL) product as it taps the retail market in sub-Saharan Africa, which was valued at $380 billion in 2021, contributing 20%-50% of the region’s GDP on average. “We want to simplify access to goods and services for the retailers and for the end consumer because we see the merchant as an agent able to make access to goods and services easier. We started out in Nigeria, and we are expanding within Francophone Africa on our way to being a pan-African player,” said Dakayi-Kamga. Amit Bhatti, the principal at 500 Global while commenting on the latest funding round said, “We believe Betastore’s talented team is creating market efficiencies that have the potential to boost the growth of Africa’s retailers. With Betastore, merchants can get greater transparency into wholesaler inventories and price points.”"
Berlin-based B2B BNPL platform Mondu raises $43M Series A led by Valar in the US,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/29/2326877/,"Given the likely global recession, small businesses are reaching for new kinds of financing. Thus, the buy now, pay later business model is now expanding into this B2B world at a rate of knots. Playter has raised backing to do this, as has Hokodo, Billie and Tranch, to name a few other players. But in Germany, B2B Payments company Mondu has emerged as a significant entrant to the market. Mondu has now raised a $43 million Series A round led by U.S.-based venture capital fund Valar Ventures and will use the funding to expand into more European countries later this year. Previous investors Cherry Ventures, FinTech Collective and tech entrepreneurs and senior executives from Klarna, Zalando, and SumUp also participated. The company has now raised $57 million to date. Mondu’s BNPL for B2B solutions for merchants and marketplaces offers the main payment B2B payment options and flexible payment terms. Malte Huffmann, co-founder and co-CEO of Mondu, said in a statement: The concept of BNPL isn’t new in the B2B world; offline business trade has enjoyed it for decades. But as more companies increasingly move to digital, the need for BNPL for B2B online will grow immensely. We are on the verge of a “digitalization boom,” and Mondu wants to be part of that revolution and drive innovation within the B2B payments space. Philipp Povel, co-founder and co-CEO of Mondu, said there is a “$200 billion opportunity just in Europe and the U.S., which is bigger than the global consumer BNPL market.” Since October 2021, Mondu has signed merchant customers across industries such as beauty, cleaning and manufacturing. One example is Ionto Comed, a manufacturer in the beauty sector that supplies salons. Andrew McCormack, founding partner of Valar Ventures, commented: BNPL for B2B sits at the intersection of three huge markets that are all in transition. The B2B payments market is immense, and its transition to digital has been accelerated over the past couple of years. The B2B eCommerce market is larger than B2C but is underserved by current offerings, and supply chain financing is a growing need, particularly for SMBs. Mondu will have to expand quickly. Berlin-based Billie has raised €138.2 million so far, and Tranch in the U.K. has raised $5.6 million."
Indonesia’s Astro raises $60M to work on 15-minute grocery delivery,https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/29/astro-indonesia-grocery-delivery-60-million-funding/,"Indonesia’s sprawling archipelago has long been a headache for logistics companies, but there’s no lack of brave challengers. Jarkata-based Astro, which provides 15-minute grocery delivery, has recently closed a $60 million Series B financing round, lifting its total funding to $90 million since the business launched just nine months ago. The Series B round was led by Accel, Citius and Tiger Global, with participation from existing investors AC Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Lightspeed and Sequoia Capital India. The company declined to disclose its post-money valuation. The speed at which Astro is attracting investment goes to show the need for hefty upfront investment in the grocery delivery race, which is about establishing a logistics infrastructure quickly and locking in loyal customers ahead of rivals. Founded by Tokopedia veteran Vincent Tjendra, Astro plans to spend its funding proceeds on user acquisition, product development and hiring more staff to add to its current team of 200. As in many countries around the world, on-demand delivery got a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. But e-grocery penetration in the country remains low and is estimated to be just 0.5% by 2022, compared to China’s 6% and South Korea’s 34% in 2020. That means there’s a huge opportunity for companies like Astro that are trying to prove the convenience of online grocery ordering over brick-and-mortar visits. The e-grocery delivery market in Indonesia is projected to reach $6 billion by 2025. Astro offers 15-minute delivery within a range of 2-3 km through its network of rented “dark stores,” which are distribution hubs set up for online shopping only. The company has opted for a cash-intensive model, as it owns the entire user journey going from inventory sourcing, supply chain, mid-mile to last-mile delivery. The benefit of this heavyweight approach is that it gets to monitor the quality of customer experience. Astro currently operates in around 50 locations across Greater Jakarta, an area with 30 million residents, through a fleet of about 1,000 delivery drivers. Revenues grew more than 10x over the past few months and downloads hit 1 million, the company said. The startup is competing with incumbents like Sayurbox, HappyFresh and TaniHub to win over users. Its customers range from working professionals to young parents at home “who seek convenience,” said Tjendra. Grocery delivery is notoriously cash-burning, but Tjendra reckoned margins will improve as the business scales. The company’s main source of revenue is the gross margin it earned from the goods sold and delivery fees customers pay. A large chunk of the business’s costs comes from delivery, which the founder believed “will come down over time as we deploy for hubs and subsequently reduce the delivery distance areas.”    "
