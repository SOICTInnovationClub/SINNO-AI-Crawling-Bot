The 10 best IoT Industry 4.0 use cases for manufacturing ,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/26/the-10-best-iot-industry-4-0-use-cases-for-manufacturing/,"  Organizations in the business 4.0 area face constant requests to be quicker, more astute, less fatty, and more productive. We’ve all known about smart cities and smart homes, yet the completely computerized and IoT-empowered smart processing plant is not too far off. The IoT (Internet of Things) has demonstrated altering organizations across all sectors’ potential. When executed accurately, it can smooth out processes, further develop navigation and make additional incentives for partners, accomplices, and clients the same. No big surprise it’s the really main thrust behind Industry 4.0 – what has been portrayed as the “fourth modern” unrest. Industry 4.0 alludes to the course of computerized change in assembling/creation and related ventures to make more worth. Many consider the ongoing advanced change pattern to be closely resembling the fourth modern upheaval, thus the name. Industry 4.0 is worried about how assembling can change, by utilizing outsider stage advancements, development gas pedals, and IT/OT (functional innovation). This implies integrating state of the art innovations across network protection, enormous information, AR/VR, distributed computing, robotization, AI and IoT, to change traditional cycles and capacities carefully. The objective is to make organizations more brilliant and quicker as well as stronger and coordinated. Here are a portion of the top Industry 4.0 use instances of IoT innovation: 1. Big Data and Analytics The way things are, fabricating organizations as of now produce extensive measures of information. This could emerge out of IoT sensors, creation volumes, deals conjecture, execution information, and so on. They likewise need to manage a scope of outside data of interest and factors, for example, economic situations, governmental issues, the environment, etc. The way things are, fabricating organizations as of now produce overflowing measures of information. This could emerge out of IoT sensors, creation volumes, deals gauge, execution information, and so on. They likewise need to manage a scope of outer data of interest and factors, for example, economic situations, governmental issues, the environment, etc. Notwithstanding, issues typically emerge with regards to really putting away, handling and using that information. Physically gathering, arranging, and filtering through information, also assembling bits of knowledge, is, by and large, a tedious and arduous cycle. More terrible, it’s a misuse of human potential thinking about how productive and capable innovation is at taking care of enormous information. Large Data and Analytics apparatuses are changing this side of a business’s activities into one that happens essentially progressively and with immeasurably expanded insight applied. 2. Autonomous Robotics While we could in any case be some way off humanoid robots, with human-like insight and ability, it is shockingly experienced to produce robotization. Advanced mechanics is now broadly sent to perform dreary, high-accuracy errands in a wide range of creation lines. The potential advantages of robotized advanced mechanics in assembling are broad: • Work with ceaseless creation with restricted to-no vacation • Bring down the gamble of work-related wounds from unsafe assignments • Further developed proficiency and efficiency through the quick and independent direction Further developed advanced mechanics today don’t need a human administrator. They can self-explore as well as organize and venture through a quickly expanding number and an assortment of undertakings. 3. Simulations and Digital Twins A computerized twin is a programmatic experience or model of a genuine item, like a piece of assembling hardware or a whole office. The most widely recognized use instance of these frameworks is to run reproductions intended to distinguish shortcomings and amazing open doors for development. They can likewise be utilized to run a precautionary trial of how a framework or machine would act in unambiguous conditions. Likewise, workers can be prepared and taught utilizing the hardware prior to being placed in a genuine situation. This can be especially successful when joined with AI and AI innovations. 4. Horizontal and Vertical System Integration Even a combination guarantees that your apparatus, IoT gadgets, cycles, and labour, cooperate flawlessly. Then again, vertical reconciliation guarantees this creation information is accessible and noteworthy by various offices all through the business. The ultimate objective is to lay out consistent network and association-wide permeability for the individuals who need it. The information ought to be accessible and shareable between machines, workers, and even production networks or colleagues. This sort of interconnectedness could, for instance, assist with getting ready creation for a deferral in the production network. Or on the other hand for deals to go with choices in view of your assembling execution. 5. Industrial IoT (IIoT) In an assembling setting, IIoT is most frequently connected with gadget sensors that gather functional and natural information. These sensors are the essential information input sources used to illuminate different verticals and pursue fabricating cycles and innovation choices. Beside your assembling hardware, it can likewise apply to your office’s frameworks, for example, air sifting, HVAC, and so forth. This ceaseless assortment and sharing of information support practically any remaining IoT frameworks. 6. Cyber Security Technology Maybe the main significant disadvantage to IoT-flying your whole effort is that the more interconnected your frameworks are, the more huge the potential security gambles. Any single IoT gadget can be a potential section point for an assault, from where it can quickly spread to any remaining gadgets and frameworks inside your business activities stack. Nonetheless, this chance can be alleviated by utilizing state of the art IoT network safety frameworks. The present driving IoT security frameworks influence advancements, for example, AI, AI, and blockchain, to naturally answer assaults. These shrewd security frameworks can safeguard against a wide assortment of assaults, from social designing to ransomware to DDoS. Portions of the IoT organization can be isolated and tidied up without cutting the whole framework down. Likewise, adjusted designs and access controls can further develop security all in all. 7. The Cloud The cloud accompanies the guarantee of never-before-seen adaptability, adaptability and speed-to-advertise for organizations across all businesses. Cloud foundation is modest, secure, quick and comes pre-arranged with information redundancies and business progression measures. Endeavours can rethink explicit necessities and business cycles to the cloud, whether SaaS, CaaS, IaaS or XaaS. Cloud producing has even arisen to synchronize fabricating across topographically scattered areas. Information can be put away in close vast sums, with simple and fast access for all partners, including clients. The cloud offers various advantages from a purchaser confronting viewpoint in regards to speed, accessibility and unwavering quality. Also decreasing upward costs while acquiring, keeping up with and working foundation. 8. Additive Manufacturing (AM) AM is the modern creation name for 3D printing. 3D printing itself is the most common way of assembling items by adding more materials in layers. PC helped plan (CAD) or 3D article scanners can be utilized to make computerized models of items, which can then be imprinted in 3D. This opens numerous entryways for producers including publicly supporting plans, thoughts and client created content. Indeed, even AI can be joined with enormous information to make AI-produced advancements or developments. 9. Artificial Intelligence and Manufacturing We have previously implied a few purposes for AI in modern IoT. Most would agree that AI will definitely suffuse pretty much every computerized innovation on account of its true capacity for speed, proficiency and mechanization. It’s now seeing huge scope use in making expectations in regards to advertise patterns, supply and request and even upkeep. Helped by large information and AI, the capability of AI will just increment. For instance, machines can become equipped for recognizing and settling shortcomings autonomously of human information. 10. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality AR and VR might have encountered misfortunes because of misalignment among assumptions and reality. Yet again, be that as it may, it’s currently leisurely making strides as a groundbreaking innovation across all vectors. AR overlays can give boots-on-the-ground moment admittance to rich relevant information. For instance, it’s not difficult to envision AR focal points that give data on individual bundles as a story administrator strolls through a distribution centre. Somebody wearing an AR gadget might actually get moment cautions, tooltips, or dangerous material admonitions. Both AR and VR can likewise be utilized for preparing to utilize vivid, reasonable recreations – potentially joined with advanced twins. Might it be said that you are amped up for Industry 4.0 IoT and how it can help your business? It means quite a bit to take note that this innovation isn’t exclusively for the utilization of tremendous Enterprises; there are additionally, multitudinous use cases for SMEs. In any case, while the savvy industrial facility ideal is more feasible than any other time in recent memory, you ought to never go into a computerized change ill-equipped. In the event that you haven’t attempted this sort of activity previously, you ought to chat with an oversaw IT, master, with a history of assisting SMEs with making reasonable progress through computerized change. Also, you can get it going while at the same time staying away from every one of the most widely recognized entanglements, like an absence of methodology or fundamental IT abilities.

IKEA announces Matter-ready smart home hub,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/25/ikea-announces-matter-ready-smart-home-hub/,"  IKEA is ramping up its smart home ambitions with the launch of a Matter-ready hub. Many IoT standards have come and gone over the years. Most of these standards have promised interoperability to break down barriers but consumers have still ended up being left with numerous hubs to support their various products. Matter promises to change that. The royalty-free standard was launched and introduced by Amazon, Apple, Google, Comcast, and the Zigbee Alliance. With that kind of support, it’s off to a more promising start than its predecessors. The backing of IKEA will put the Matter smart home ecosystem in front of consumers that might not otherwise go out of their way to seek out such products. IKEA’s new smart hub is called DIRIGERA and succeeds the Swedish brand’s existing TRÅDFRI gateway. DIRIGERA is also being launched alongside a “more user-friendly” IKEA Home app. “With DIRIGERA and the new app, one of our focuses has been on strengthening and simplifying the onboarding process when connecting new smart products to the smart home. We have also added personalisation options, such as creating different scenes with pre-set functions of the smart products for all your different activities and moments in the home”, says Rebecca Töreman, Business Leader at IKEA of Sweden. “Thanks to the user feedback we’ve received since launching the TRÅDFRI gateway in 2014, we can continue to merge technology with simplicity and accessibility and bring our home furnishing expertise into the future,” Töreman continues. The pandemic made people realise the importance of creating a home that’s comfortable and makes their lives easier. “We have seen an increasing interest in the home, particularly the smart home during the past couple of years. Digital solutions and technology have become natural ingredients in our everyday lives and now also in our homes”, says Björn Block, Business Area Manager at IKEA of Sweden. “The smart home is an evolution of the home you already love and live in. The wide offer of smart products from IKEA is in the areas of sound, light, air purification, blinds, and many more to come in the future.” Any existing products that have been purchased for the existing TRÅDFRI gateway can be connected to DIRIGERA. Those who aren’t yet ready to upgrade can still use the current gateway and app and will continue to receive security updates for at least three years. DIRIGERA and the new IKEA home app are set to launch in October 2022. Remote access is due to launch in 1H 2023. (Image Credit: IKEA) Want to learn about the IoT from industry leaders?

LoRaWAN is an open standard for IoT low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs). The LoRa Alliance has more than 500 members – including the likes of IBM, Cisco, HP, Foxconn, Semtech, Bosch, and Schneider – and has promoted the expansion of the LoRaWAN ecosystem since 2015. Deployments of LPWAN networks have been traditionally driven by mobile network operators. However, the LoRa Alliance notes that much of the recent growth “has been enabled largely by non-MNOs that are building critical dedicated infrastructure to support the expanding needs of LPWAN IoT.” Recent investments by satellite and community LoRaWAN network providers have further increased coverage. Donna Moore, CEO and Chairwoman of the LoRa Alliance, said: “LoRaWAN network operators are building new types of infrastructure to meet future IoT networking requirements. This evolution in the types of networks and network providers is expected—and a sign of a healthy and vibrant market. These new network players are nimble, agile and able to grow beyond the constraints of preexisting network infrastructure. They are successfully building profitable business models to maximize the value of their LoRaWAN networks and meet the evolving needs of LPWAN IoT deployments.  LoRaWAN is the only LPWAN providing a choice of network types, along with interoperability and roaming between networks, that will continue to drive strong growth in LoRaWAN network capacity.” The LoRa Alliance sees the growth in diversity of LoRaWAN networks – including public, community, satellite, and private, as well as hybrid network approaches – as a key differentiator. “The installed base of LPWAN devices will exceed 2 billion units in 2025,” commented Steve Hoffenberg, Director and Industry Analyst at market research firm VDC Research. “With LoRaWAN’s low-cost gateways, ready adaptability to both public and private networks, and satellite capability, it is uniquely positioned to bring connectivity to the widest range of devices and places, helping to drive the market growth of LPWANs.” (Photo by Jungwoo Hong on Unsplash) Want to learn about the IoT from industry leaders?

Fronton botnet can launch trending disinformation campaigns,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/23/fronton-botnet-launch-trending-disinformation-campaigns/,"  A Russian IoT botnet known as Fronton can use inauthentic coordinated behaviour to launch disinformation trends on social media. “Trends” on social media platforms are how many people keep updated with what’s going on in the world. There’s growing awareness of not believing everything that’s posted under a trend – especially around developing events like terror attacks – but there’s often an acceptance that it’s trending because enough real people are posting about it. IoT devices have become the perfect targets for botnets due to their rapid proliferation, often poor security, global distribution, and always-on nature. Such IoT botnets have launched record-breaking DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks. Hacktivist group Digital Revolution uncovered the Fronton botnet in March 2020. The group released documents about the botnet after claiming to have hacked a subcontractor of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation. Initial details about the botnet focused on its serious DDoS abilities and resulted in headlines saying that it could “Disconnect the internet in a small country”. However, many missed the release of further documents, images, and a video that revealed its other big capability. Virginia-based computer security firm Nisos delved deeper into this additional information and found that Fronton includes a web-based dashboard called SANA. In a blog post, Nisos explained: “SANA creates social media persona accounts, including provisioning of an email and phone number. In addition, the system provides facilities for creating these newsbreaks on a schedule or a reactive basis.” The creation of fake social accounts from around the world and using them in a coordinated manner to start trends would be difficult for any social media platform to detect. However, the implications are huge. We’ve seen disinformation campaigns launched to stoke divisions around topics like COVID-19 and immigration. There are also credible reports they’ve been used to influence democratic processes like elections. Russia’s unwarranted, barbaric, and illegal invasion of Ukraine has led Sweden and Finland to drop their historic stance of military neutrality and apply to join NATO—fearing they could otherwise be left unprotected if Russia decides to invade other neighbouring countries. “Russia has said that it will take countermeasures if we join NATO,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters on May 16. “We cannot rule out that Sweden will be exposed to, for instance, disinformation and attempts to intimidate and divide us.” Everyone should be vigilant that botnets like Fronton can be used to launch trending disinformation campaigns and that, more than ever, it’s vital to ensure that all information is verified from a trusted source before sharing it or using it to form an opinion.

Wayve partners with Microsoft to scale AI for autonomous vehicles,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/19/wayve-partners-microsoft-scale-ai-autonomous-vehicles/,"  London-based Wayve has partnered with Microsoft to access the supercomputing infrastructure it requires to scale its AI models for autonomous vehicles. Wayve and Microsoft already have a close relationship. Microsoft participated in Wayve’s $200 million Series B investment round and Wayze began using Azure in 2020 after its computing requirements grew beyond its in-house 12-HDD RAID array and the SSD-based cache server that superseded it. Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, said: “Joining forces with Microsoft to design the supercomputing infrastructure needed to accelerate deep learning for autonomous mobility is an opportunity that we are honoured to lead. Deep learning systems thrive on data, and we’ve put an immense amount of effort into understanding what it takes to get these systems on the road. We are excited by the opportunities that this collaboration will create as we push deep learning to new levels of scale.” While current self-driving systems require expensive hardware, HD mapping, and complex localisation systems, Wayze’s approach claims to be able to apply its driving intelligence to areas where it’s never been used before. This was demonstrated last year when Wayve deployed its autonomous driving system across five new UK cities. The system was able to safely navigate the cities using the same driving skills it’s been learning in London; without the need for any city-specific adaptations. Two of the UK’s largest grocery retailers – Asda and Ocado – are set to trial Wayve’s autonomous technology as part of its last-mile delivery operations in London. Logistics giant DPD, meanwhile, will provide additional driving data to Wayze from across its Greater London van fleet. However, Wayze says its deep learning workloads are now reaching the limit of what commercial cloud and edge computing services can handle—hence the recruitment of Microsoft’s specialist infrastructure services. Mark Russinovich, CTO of Azure at Microsoft, commented: “Supercomputing capabilities are key to processing the immense amount of data required for the simulation, validation, and training of AI models that enable safe and secure autonomous driving. Wayve is combining its expertise in deep learning-based autonomous vehicle systems with Microsoft Azure computing power to bring self-driving transportation experiences to more people and organisations faster.” Wayve believes its partnership with Microsoft will unlock its full potential to power the future of mobility.

Frost & Sullivan awards Losant with innovation leadership award,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/17/frost-sullivan-awards-losant-innovation-leadership-award/,"  Business consulting giant Frost & Sullivan has awarded Losant with an innovation leadership award. The award is for Losant’s Embedded Edge Agent (EEA) which the company spent two years of R&D creating: EEA was introduced towards the end of 2021 and brings Losant’s usability to previously incapable low-power, embedded hardware. “Unlike market leaders who use a full-code approach, Losant’s platform is low-code based and therefore more usable than other platforms that require customised development. Losant’s full application programming interface (API) helps clients customise their IoT solution and integrate with additional internal or external services faster,” said Carina Gonçalves, Industry Principal at Frost & Sullivan. “The drag-and-drop workflow editor stands out in the market because it allows enterprises to build custom workflows and manage complex interactions between edge devices, networks, and the cloud on their own, without programming resources.” Losant’s IoT platform features both the EEA and a Gateway Edge Agent (GEA). GEA requires far more computing power – including 512MB of memory – but exposes more functionality. GEA is typically installed on an industrial gateway or modern computer in a private network. In contrast, EEA has minimal hardware requirements. Requiring just 2MB of memory, EEA is typically integrated into embedded hardware deep within a larger system. “Losant takes a unique approach to the market, with a solution that is at once portable, usable, and customisable. The platform can be deployed in public or private clouds or on-premises environments, whereas most market players can only implement their platforms in public cloud or on-premises native environments,” added Gonçalves. “Frost & Sullivan believes these unified, embedded, and edge workflows in the field with application and experience workflows in the cloud are a market-first value proposition that can appeal to many customers with hybrid environments.” Losant is sponsoring, exhibiting, and speaking at IoT Tech Expo North America 2022.

Royal Mail plans fleet of 500 drones for rural deliveries,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/12/royal-mail-plans-fleet-of-500-drones-for-rural-deliveries/,"  British postal service Royal Mail is planning to use a fleet of 500 drones for deliveries to rural locations. The pandemic reminded many of us of the vital role the humble postie plays in keeping people connected. However, many rural communities struggle to access the services we often take for granted due to their location. Royal Mail wants to change that and has identified over 50 postal routes it wants to create using drones over the next three years. The company is partnering with logistics drone firm Windracers on the effort and the first routes identified for the service include the Isles of Scilly, Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands, and the Hebrides. Stephen Wright, Chairman at Windracers, said: “The middle mile of supply and logistics, especially to remote locations, has long been overlooked by the industry and is ripe for innovation. We’ve spent the last five years focused on developing the most commercially viable essential logistics drones so we’re truly delighted to be working with Royal Mail on this ambitious and pioneering deployment of autonomous aircraft. It puts the UK firmly at the forefront of this exciting sector.”  The UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) will provide faster and more convenient to customers in remote communities. Royal Mail has conducted four trials in the last 18 months. The most recent trial was held last month on the Shetland Islands where a UAV made the 50-mile flight (each way) between Tingwall Airport in Lerwick to Unst. In the trial, a twin-engine UAV with an autopilot system was used to make the trip. Once at the destination, the drone is unloaded and letters and parcels delivered by the local postie. Each UAV can carry up to 100kg of mail of all shapes and sizes. Beyond helping to connect rural communities, Royal Mail believes the UAVs will help it to further reduce its carbon emissions. Simon Thompson, Chief Executive Officer at Royal Mail, commented: “On-time delivery regardless of our customer’s location or the weather – whilst protecting our environment – is our goal. Even though we go everywhere, Royal Mail already has the lowest CO2 emissions per parcel delivered, this initiative will help reduce our emissions even further.”  The rollout will be subject to approvals from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) but Royal Mail is aiming to deploy 200 drones over the next three years to support over 50 new routes. Long-term, Royal Mail said it’s aiming to more than double that number to create a fleet of 500 drones “servicing all corners of the UK”.

Inmarsat reveals the drivers and challenges of IoT deployments,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/apr/22/inmarsat-reveals-drivers-and-challenges-of-iot-deployments/,"  Research from satellite telecoms giant Inmarsat highlights the factors driving IoT adoption in addition to what is hampering successful deployments. Over half (54%) of respondents said that cost-efficiency is their leading reason for adopting IoT technologies. This was followed by environmental sustainability and greater supply chain insight—both at 48 percent. Organisations with a formal IoT strategy are reaping the most benefits in terms of those leading drivers of improving cost-efficiencies and sustainability. Without a formal IoT strategy in place, 52 percent felt their investments met or surpassed their expectations for cost-efficiencies and 53 percent for environmental sustainability. With a formal IoT strategy, that increased considerably to 73 percent and 71 percent respectively. “The efficiency gains and cost savings IoT can deliver, in addition to the huge environmental benefits, paints a clear picture as to why most organisations are pursuing IoT,” said Mike Carter, President of Inmarsat Enterprise. In terms of barriers, a lack of in-house skills (37%) was listed as the main obstacle in a new IoT deployment. This problem is particularly acute in organisations without a formal IoT strategy in place as 47 percent of this group continue to struggle post-deployment from a lack of skills. This drops by more than half to 21 percent in organisations with a formal IoT strategy. The next major barrier was a lack of reliable connectivity (24%). “To get the optimum benefits from their IoT deployments, organisations must ensure they have all the right skillsets and connectivity requirements in place. The research shows that organisations struggling to implement the right connectivity strategies are lagging behind their peers, and those with a formal IoT strategy are better placed to reap the benefits of optimised and more sustainable operations,” adds Carter. “We can see that too many businesses still struggle to deploy IoT projects due to unreliable, insecure, or poor connectivity. This is where satellite IoT connectivity can play a key role. Some of the most valuable data often hails from the hardest to reach places, so investing in effective collection, storage and analysis of that data is crucial to successful IoT strategies. Organisations that aren’t struggling from connectivity problems are, understandably, finding more success from their IoT deployments. However, 25 percent report suffering from a lack of consistent and reliable connectivity post-deployment. “Inmarsat ELERA, our industry-leading narrowband network, is ideally suited to the rapidly evolving world of IoT. The billions of devices being connected every year are benefitting from global reach, extraordinary resilience, and the fastest speeds, along with the smallest, lowest-cost terminals in their class,” explains Carter. “ELERA is inspiring new possibilities and enabling organisations from all sectors to access IoT anywhere. It will be a catalyst for the next wave of world-changing technologies, so organisations looking to accelerate their IoT deployments need look no further than Inmarsat and our global partner ecosystem – the widest of any satellite provider – to solve their IoT connectivity needs.” Inmarsat is hosting its ELEVATE event at 6pm on 10 May 2022 at Cisco Lounge, Levi’s Stadium, 4900 Marie P DeBartolo Way, Santa Clara, CA.

GlobalData: These advances will make the metaverse a success,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/apr/29/globaldata-advances-make-the-metaverse-success/,"  Analysts from GlobalData have revealed the advances they believe will power the metaverse and drive adoption. “Latency is a key hindrance to the metaverse adoption. Several companies are trying to address this issue from various angles as per their technical or business acumen,” said Kiran Raj, Practice Head of Disruptive Tech at GlobalData. “Potential solutions could be in terms of network protocols, software applications, or hardware such as chips and AR and VR devices.” Among the potential solutions is a new internet protocol by Syntropy called DARP (Decentralised Autonomous Routing Protocol). DARP connects data centres around the world and can detect performance issues and instantly switch to a better-performing channel.  GlobalData says that new protocols like DARP will reduce network latency and help to support the metaverse and web 3.0 applications through its decentralisation properties. Another latency-buster on GlobalData’s list is Wi-Fi 7. GlobalData says that advanced multi-link operation (MLO) enables Wi-Fi 7 devices to aggregate channels and quickly switch between them—maintaining performance in high-density, congested networks. “Data flow needs to be quick and continuous as the demand for higher internet speed is increasing every day with the advent of emerging technologies,” comments Abhishek Paul Choudhury, Senior Disruptive Tech Analyst at GlobalData. “Decentralised routing protocols along with technological advancements like Wi-Fi 7, blockchain, and edge computing can bring in better throughput and low latency as compared to the existing network capabilities.” On the applications side, GlobalData points towards a SaaS-based conferencing app created by Swiss startup TYXIT. The app’s patented technology support latency of under 30ms – akin to playing in the same room – which could enable real-time sound transfer for immersive experiences like concerts in the metaverse. Finally, immersive experiences will require cutting-edge peripherals. A collaboration between wearable computing giant Vuzix and mobile operator Verizon sees the former harnessing the latter’s 5G and edge computing technologies. The combination of technologies enables Vuzix’s smart glasses to operate for longer, with increased computing capacity, and with improved response times. “The metaverse’s objective is for everyone, or at least a large number of individuals, to join as it is a social technology. As more people join, the number of synchronizations rises, along with network load,” adds Choudhury. “The development of emerging technologies has the potential to minimise latency and play a pivotal role for the metaverse to be a success.” (Photo by and machines on Unsplash) Want to learn about the IoT from industry leaders?

Public LoRaWAN networks grow by 66% over three years,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/05/public-lorawan-networks-grow-by-66-over-three-years/,"  The LoRa Alliance has announced that public LoRaWAN networks have grown by 66 percent over the past three years. LoRaWAN is an open standard for IoT low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs). The LoRa Alliance has more than 500 members – including the likes of IBM, Cisco, HP, Foxconn, Semtech, Bosch, and Schneider – and has promoted the expansion of the LoRaWAN ecosystem since 2015. Deployments of LPWAN networks have been traditionally driven by mobile network operators. However, the LoRa Alliance notes that much of the recent growth “has been enabled largely by non-MNOs that are building critical dedicated infrastructure to support the expanding needs of LPWAN IoT.” Recent investments by satellite and community LoRaWAN network providers have further increased coverage. Donna Moore, CEO and Chairwoman of the LoRa Alliance, said: “LoRaWAN network operators are building new types of infrastructure to meet future IoT networking requirements. This evolution in the types of networks and network providers is expected—and a sign of a healthy and vibrant market. These new network players are nimble, agile and able to grow beyond the constraints of preexisting network infrastructure. They are successfully building profitable business models to maximize the value of their LoRaWAN networks and meet the evolving needs of LPWAN IoT deployments.  LoRaWAN is the only LPWAN providing a choice of network types, along with interoperability and roaming between networks, that will continue to drive strong growth in LoRaWAN network capacity.” The LoRa Alliance sees the growth in diversity of LoRaWAN networks – including public, community, satellite, and private, as well as hybrid network approaches – as a key differentiator. “The installed base of LPWAN devices will exceed 2 billion units in 2025,” commented Steve Hoffenberg, Director and Industry Analyst at market research firm VDC Research. “With LoRaWAN’s low-cost gateways, ready adaptability to both public and private networks, and satellite capability, it is uniquely positioned to bring connectivity to the widest range of devices and places, helping to drive the market growth of LPWANs.” (Photo by Jungwoo Hong on Unsplash) Want to learn about the IoT from industry leaders?

Survey: Adoption of digital transformation tech is accelerating￼,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/apr/13/survey-adoption-digital-transformation-tech-accelerating/,"  According to a survey of UK leaders conducted by bluQube, the adoption of digital transformation technologies is accelerating. “So-called ‘future’ technologies, such as robotics or the Internet of Things, have now firmly entered the mainstream for businesses looking to grow and stand out from the chasing pack,” commented Simon Kearsley, CEO of bluQube. Almost three-quarters (72%) of business leaders report their organisations have adopted mobile technology. An equal percentage say they’re using the cloud for their operations. As established technologies, it’s not particularly surprising. The IoT – adopted by almost half of businesses (48%) – only fell behind mobile and cloud. Further down the list, but still seeing notable adoption, are AI and machine learning. Close to a third (30%) of leaders report using these technologies. Augmented reality is also seeing impressive adoption, with more than a fifth (21%) now using it for their operations. Among the more emerging technologies that are growing but yet to see widespread adoption are: digital twins (18.7%), robotics (12.7%), and interoperable systems (12.7%). “Adoption still has a long way to go in certain areas, with all-too-many businesses neglecting the potentially-transformative benefits of underlooked technologies such as those that offer interoperability, which can significantly streamline day-to-day operations and revolutionise how businesses work,” added Kearsley. The report notes that 78 percent of businesses have identified these digital transformation technologies as helping to drive growth in their organisation—showing the appetite is there for continued investment. 76 percent of the leaders say the pandemic-induced acceleration of remote working hastened their organisation’s plans to implement digital technologies. With rocketing fuel costs further adding to the appetite for remote working, more businesses are committing to continuing the advancements they’ve made in this area over the pandemic. 36 percent of business leaders believe they will have to implement more technology to support the continuation of hybrid or remote working models Here are the areas where businesses feel digital transformation is benefitting them the most: “By using the right innovative technologies to automate and streamline time-consuming, repetitive tasks, businesses can unlock the true potential of their staff, and free up team time and headspace to focus on the more strategic, involved tasks that drive the business forwards,” explains Kearsley.

What cloud-based IoT software means for the future of security,https://www.iottechnews.com/news/2022/may/03/what-cloud-based-iot-software-means-for-the-future-of-security/,"  72% of information security leaders state that cloud computing represents a top priority in digital transformation. Cloud-based IoT software is changing the nature of both digital and physical security, allowing both security elements to be merged and used to leverage data better. So, what does cloud-based IoT software mean for the future of security? Keep reading to learn about the ways cloud-based software is helping to improve efficiency and convenience in the security sphere. This guide will cover how digital and physical security elements are being combined for better security incident response. Let’s dive in and discuss the ways cloud-based IoT software can be used in commercial settings, and some of the benefits cloud-based solutions bring to the security sphere. Central to this advancement, IoT technology is facilitating changes in many sectors on a global scale, and revolutionising daily operations for many businesses. Data is key to success in just about every industry, and security is no different. You can integrate cloud-based solutions to house all information on one interface to get a clearer picture of what’s happening in your business. For instance, integrating cloud-based access control systems with a security camera feed allows for visual identity verification in real-time.   You can also integrate cloud-based solutions with analytics and AI-enhanced software that allow security staff to identify potential security threats more efficiently. For example, Ava Aware aggregates data from access logs and security camera feeds, using analytics to create triggers when unusual activity is detected. These triggers work proactively to minimise threats and criminal activity, rather than simply using the data as evidence once a crime has already occurred.  Leveraging cloud-based IoT technology also enables swift responses and improves productivity. Since security staff have a wide range of responsibilities, they cannot consistently monitor the video camera feed and access logs. Mobile technology helps build a better security strategy by allowing security staff to receive updates from any location, on-site or remotely. Openpath, a Motorola Solutions access control provider, uses live alerts sent to security staff via their mobile device, with the ability to integrate with live video and AI analytics tools to enhance security system functionality and speed responses to security incidents.  Another way IoT and cloud-based security systems can be optimised is by combining digital and physical security, also known as security convergence. Cybersecurity software is necessary to protect a cloud-based physical security system from online vulnerabilities and breaches. Similarly, physical security measures help guard data and confidential information from falling into the wrong hands. Converging cyber and physical security teams results in a more holistic, collaborative strategy. The more integrated all the physical and digital security elements of a commercial system, the more protected and future-proof the organisation will be. Future-proofing your technology requires keeping up-to-date with current versions of the technology you are employing in your security strategy. Keeping all software up-to-date is essential to ensure no vulnerabilities in your cloud-based system could leave your organisation open to cybersecurity threats. Traditionally, on-premise security systems need to be manually updated by a certified professional every time there’s a new upgrade. With cloud-based software, updates can be automated, and performed remotely, meaning that it requires minimal effort to keep your software up-to-date. In today’s increasingly flexible and connected work environment, cloud-based IoT security software allows employees to operate security tools using their mobile devices remotely. For instance, if your building uses a video intercom system for combined access and visitor management, your security staff will be able to verify the identity of visitors with an easy video call to their smartphone. Plus, the mobile app features a convenient remote unlock option to grant guests entry once they’ve identified themselves. This ensures no security incidents occur due to misappropriated access credentials. Verifying visitor and user identity remotely allows visitors to enter the building without a lengthy wait. It can take a while for security staff to get to the building’s entrance to verify visitor identity in person and unlock the door to the building, so the remote capabilities of cloud-based IoT technologies allow for faster entry to the building.  Because misappropriated access credentials are one of the main concerns associated with access control, having integrated video feed and access information on one interface can help mitigate these concerns. With a fully remote access dashboard, cloud-based systems like Openpath allow security staff a faster means for verifying identity and ensuring access credentials belong to their authorised users. If you’re adopting cloud-based IoT solutions in your security strategy, you have the opportunity to create a future-proof security system. Cybersecurity is a significant concern when businesses adopt IoT technologies, but by merging physical and digital security, you can ensure your cloud-based system is well-protected from vulnerabilities. Integrating physical and digital security concepts will help your security and IT teams handle the changing security landscape. Want to learn about the IoT from industry leaders?
